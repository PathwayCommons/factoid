Setup
================================================================================

This project requires that you install node.js on your system.  All other
dependencies for running the project are included in node_modules, so you can 
just run `node app` in the terminal to start the server.


Tests
================================================================================

Tests use the nodeunit library, which you can install: 

	sudo npm install -g nodeunit

And then you can run the tests:

	nodeunit tests

Add tests in the tests directory.  Tests for module `foo` should be in
`tests/foo.js`, for example.
