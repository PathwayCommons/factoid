            "Abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the master growth regulator mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1], and is associated with human disease. We performed quantitative proteomic analyses of rapidly isolated lysosomes and found that nutrient levels and mTOR dynamically modulate the lysosomal proteome. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, NUFIP1 (nuclear fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 1) redistributes from the nucleus to autophagosomes and lysosomes. Upon these conditions, NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and delivers them to autophagosomes by directly binding to microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B). The starvation-induced degradation of ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) depends on the capacity of NUFIP1 to bind LC3B and promotes cell survival. We propose that NUFIP1 is a receptor for the selective autophagy of ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Analyses of proteomes from a large number of organisms throughout the domains of life highlight the key role played by multiprotein complexes for the implementation of cellular function. While the occurrence of multiprotein assemblies is ubiquitous, the understanding of pathways that dictate the formation of quaternary structure remains enigmatic. Interestingly, there are now well-established examples of protein complexes that are assembled co-translationally in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and indications are that the phenomenon is widespread in cells. Here, we review complex assembly with an emphasis on co-translational pathways, which involve interactions of nascent chains with other nascent or mature partner proteins, respectively. In prokaryotes, such interactions are promoted by the polycistronic arrangement of mRNA and the associated co-translation of functionally related cell constituents in order to enhance otherwise diffusion-dependent processes. Beyond merely stochastic events, however, co-translational complex formation may be sensitive to subunit availability and allow for overall regulation of the assembly process. We speculate how co-translational pathways may constitute integral components of quality control systems to ensure the correct and complete formation of hundreds of heterogeneous assemblies in a single cell. Coupling of folding of intrinsically disordered domains with co-translational interaction of binding partners may furthermore enhance the efficiency and fidelity with which correct conformation is attained. Co-translational complex formation may constitute a fundamental pathway of cellular organization, with profound importance for health and disease.",

Here we describe RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID), which uses proximity-dependent protein labeling, based on the BirA* biotin ligase, to rapidly identify the proteins that bind RNA sequences of interest in living cells. RaPID displays utility in multiple applications, including in evaluating protein binding to mutant RNA motifs in human genetic disorders, in uncovering potential post-transcriptional networks in breast cancer, and in discovering essential host proteins that interact with Zika virus RNA. To improve the BirA*-labeling component of RaPID, moreover, a new mutant BirA* was engineered from Bacillus subtilis, termed BASU, that enables >1,000-fold faster kinetics and >30-fold increased signal-to-noise ratio over the prior standard Escherichia coli BirA*, thereby enabling direct study of RNA-protein interactions in living cells on a timescale as short as 1 min.",

Here, we developed, validated, and implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.",

Here, we discuss mechanisms by which the ribosome assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport machineries collaborate to produce functional ribosomes. We also highlight recent cryo-EM studies that provided unprecedented snapshots of ribosomes during assembly and quality control.",

            "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and there is great interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of individual tumors. We used systems-level approaches to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of the protein-coding genes of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome. A general pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that cancer patients have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. All data are presented in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcomes.",

Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.",

In the past two decades, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy has contributed a major share of information on structure, binding modes, and conformational changes of the ribosome during its work cycle, but the contributions of this technique in the translation field have recently skyrocketed after the introduction of a new recording medium capable of detecting individual electrons. As many examples in the recent literature over the past three years show, the impact of this development on the advancement of knowledge in this field has been transformative and promises to be lasting.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomes are composed of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and imported into the nucleus for assembly with the rRNAs. It has been shown that chaperones or karyopherins responsible for import can maintain the stability of ribosomal proteins by neutralizing unfavorable positive charges and thus facilitate their transports. Among 79 ribosomal proteins in yeast, only a few are identified with specific chaperones. Besides the classic role in maintaining protein stability, chaperones have additional roles in transport, chaperoning the assembly site, and dissociation of ribosomal proteins from karyopherins. Bcp1 has been shown to be necessary for the export of Mss4, a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, and required for ribosome biogenesis. However, its specific function in ribosome biogenesis has not been described. Here, we show that Bcp1 dissociates Rpl23 from the karyopherins and associates with Rpl23 afterward. Loss of Bcp1 causes instability of Rpl23 and deficiency of 60S subunits. In summary, Bcp1 is a novel 60S biogenesis factor via chaperoning Rpl23 in the nucleus.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled from their components, the ribosomal RNAs and ribosomal proteins, in a tremendously complex, multi-step process, which primarily takes place in the nuclear compartment. Therefore, most ribosomal proteins have to travel from the cytoplasm to their incorporation site on pre-ribosomes within the nucleus. However, due to their particular characteristics, such as a highly basic amino acid composition and the presence of unstructured extensions, ribosomal proteins are especially prone to aggregation and degradation in their unassembled state, hence specific mechanisms must operate to ensure their safe delivery. Recent studies have uncovered a group of proteins, termed dedicated chaperones, specialized in accompanying and guarding individual ribosomal proteins. In this essay, we review how these dedicated chaperones utilize different folds to interact with their ribosomal protein clients and how they ensure their soluble expression and interconnect their intracellular transport with their efficient assembly into pre-ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "After their cytoplasmic synthesis, ribosomal proteins need to be transported into the nucleus, where they assemble with ribosomal RNA into pre-ribosomal particles. Due to their physicochemical properties, they need protection from aggregation on this path. Newly synthesized ribosomal protein Rps3 forms a dimer that is associated with one molecule of its specific chaperone Yar1. Here we report that redundant pathways contribute to the nuclear import of Rps3, with the classical importin α/β pathway (Kap60/Kap95 in yeast) constituting a main import route. The Kap60/Kap95 heterodimer mediates efficient nuclear import of Rps3 by recognition of an N-terminal monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). This Rps3-NLS is located directly adjacent to the Yar1-binding site and, upon binding of Kap60 to Rps3, Yar1 is displaced from the ribosomal protein in vitro. While Yar1 does not directly interact with Kap60 in vitro, affinity purifications of Yar1 and Rps3, however, revealed that Kap60 is present in the Rps3/Yar1 complex in vivo. Indeed we could reconstitute such a protein complex containing Rps3 and both Yar1 and Kap60 in vitro. Our data suggest that binding of Yar1 to one N-domain and binding of Kap60 to the second N-domain of dimerized Rps3 orchestrates import and protection of the ribosomal protein.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

Our previous studies suggested that Zfrp8 functions in the formation of mRNP (mRNA ribonucleoprotein) complexes and also controls RNA of select Transposable Elements (TEs). Here we show that in Zfrp8/PDCD2 knock down (KD) ovaries, specific mRNAs and TE transcripts show increased nuclear accumulation. We also show that Zfrp8/PDCD2 interacts with the (40S) small ribosomal subunit through direct interaction with RpS2 (uS5). By studying the distribution of endogenous and transgenic fluorescently tagged ribosomal proteins we demonstrate that Zfrp8/PDCD2 regulates the cytoplasmic levels of components of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, but does not control nuclear/nucleolar localization of ribosomal proteins. Our results suggest that Zfrp8/PDCD2 functions at late stages of ribosome assembly and may regulate the binding of specific mRNA-RNPs to the small ribosomal subunit ultimately controlling their cytoplasmic localization and translation.

In humans, the telomerase RNA (hTR) is a non-polyadenylated transcript produced from an independent transcriptional unit. As yet, the mechanism and factors responsible for hTR 3' end processing have remained largely unknown. Here, we show that hTR is matured via a polyadenylation-dependent pathway that relies on the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 and the poly(A)-specific RNase PARN. Depletion of PABPN1 and PARN results in telomerase RNA deficiency and the accumulation of polyadenylated precursors. Accordingly, a deficiency in PABPN1 leads to impaired telomerase activity and telomere shortening. In contrast, we find that hTRAMP-dependent polyadenylation and exosome-mediated degradation function antagonistically to hTR maturation, thereby limiting telomerase RNA accumulation. Our findings unveil a critical requirement for RNA polyadenylation in telomerase RNA biogenesis, providing alternative approaches for telomerase inhibition in cancer.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomes are the highly complex macromolecular assemblies dedicated to the synthesis of all cellular proteins from mRNA templates. The main principles underlying the making of ribosomes are conserved across eukaryotic organisms and this process has been studied in most detail in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast ribosomes are composed of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Most r-proteins need to be transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they get incorporated into the evolving pre-ribosomal particles. Due to the high abundance and difficult physicochemical properties of r-proteins, their correct folding and fail-safe targeting to the assembly site depends largely on general, as well as highly specialized, chaperone and transport systems. Many r-proteins contain universally conserved or eukaryote-specific internal loops and/or terminal extensions, which were shown to mediate their nuclear targeting and association with dedicated chaperones in a growing number of cases. The 60S r-protein Rpl4 is particularly interesting since it harbours a conserved long internal loop and a prominent C-terminal eukaryote-specific extension. Here we show that both the long internal loop and the C-terminal eukaryote-specific extension are strictly required for the functionality of Rpl4. While Rpl4 contains at least five distinct nuclear localization signals (NLS), the C-terminal part of the long internal loop associates with a specific binding partner, termed Acl4. Absence of Acl4 confers a severe slow-growth phenotype and a deficiency in the production of 60S subunits. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Acl4 can be considered as a dedicated chaperone of Rpl4. Notably, Acl4 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus and it has the capacity to capture nascent Rpl4 in a co-translational manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that the dedicated chaperone Acl4 accompanies Rpl4 from the cytoplasm to its pre-60S assembly site in the nucleus. ",

This essential process is carried out by the ribosome, a ribonucleoprotein complex of remarkable size and intricacy. Although the structure of the mature ribosome has provided insight into the mechanism of translation, our knowledge regarding the assembly, quality control, and intracellular targeting of this molecular machine is still emerging. Assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome begins in the nucleolus and requires more than 350 conserved assembly factors, which transiently associate with the preribosome at specific maturation stages. After accomplishing their tasks, early-acting assembly factors are released, preparing preribosomes for nuclear export. Export competent preribosomal subunits are transported through nuclear pore complexes into the cytoplasm, where they undergo final maturation steps, which are closely connected to quality control, before engaging in translation. In this chapter, we focus on the final events that commit correctly assembled ribosomal subunits for translation. ",

Using high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners for 2,594 human proteins in HEK293T cells. The resulting network (BioPlex) contains 23,744 interactions among 7,668 proteins with 86% previously undocumented. BioPlex accurately depicts known complexes, attaining 80%-100% coverage for most CORUM complexes. The network readily subdivides into communities that correspond to complexes or clusters of functionally related proteins. More generally, network architecture reflects cellular localization, biological process, and molecular function, enabling functional characterization of thousands of proteins. Network structure also reveals associations among thousands of protein domains, suggesting a basis for examining structurally related proteins. Finally, BioPlex, in combination with other approaches, can be used to reveal interactions of biological or clinical significance. For example, mutations in the membrane protein VAPB implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis perturb a defined community of interactors. ",

            "abstract": "Exponentially growing yeast cells produce every minute >160,000 ribosomal proteins. Owing to their difficult physicochemical properties, the synthesis of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins represents a major challenge. Recent evidence highlights that dedicated chaperone proteins recognize the N-terminal regions of ribosomal proteins and promote their soluble expression and delivery to the assembly site. Here we explore the intuitive possibility that ribosomal proteins are captured by dedicated chaperones in a co-translational manner. Affinity purification of four chaperones (Rrb1, Syo1, Sqt1 and Yar1) selectively enriched the mRNAs encoding their specific ribosomal protein clients (Rpl3, Rpl5, Rpl10 and Rps3). X-ray crystallography reveals how the N-terminal, rRNA-binding residues of Rpl10 are shielded by Sqt1's WD-repeat β-propeller, providing mechanistic insight into the incorporation of Rpl10 into pre-60S subunits. Co-translational capturing of nascent ribosomal proteins by dedicated chaperones constitutes an elegant mechanism to prevent unspecific interactions and aggregation of ribosomal proteins on their road to incorporation.

            "abstract": "The poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 is encoded by the PABPN1 gene, whose mutations result in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a late-onset disorder for which the molecular basis remains unknown. Despite recent studies investigating the functional roles of PABPN1, little is known about its regulation. Here, we show that PABPN1 negatively controls its own expression to maintain homeostatic levels in human cells. Transcription from the PABPN1 gene results in the accumulation of two major isoforms: an unspliced nuclear transcript that retains the 3'-terminal intron and a fully spliced cytoplasmic mRNA. Increased dosage of PABPN1 protein causes a significant decrease in the spliced/unspliced ratio, reducing the levels of endogenous PABPN1 protein. We also show that PABPN1 autoregulation requires inefficient splicing of its 3'-terminal intron. Our data suggest that autoregulation occurs via the binding of PABPN1 to an adenosine (A)-rich region in its 3' untranslated region, which promotes retention of the 3'-terminal intron and clearance of intron-retained pre-mRNAs by the nuclear exosome. Our findings unveil a mechanism of regulated intron retention coupled to nuclear pre-mRNA decay that functions in the homeostatic control of PABPN1 expression.",

In contrast to prokaryotes, many eukaryotic RPs possess long extensions that interdigitate in the mature ribosome. RpL4 is a prime example, with an ∼80-residue-long surface extension of unknown function. Here, we identify assembly chaperone Acl4 that initially binds the universally conserved internal loop of newly synthesized RpL4 via its superhelical TPR domain, thereby restricting RpL4 loop insertion at its cognate nascent rRNA site. RpL4 release from Acl4 is orchestrated with pre-ribosome assembly, during which the eukaryote-specific RpL4 extension makes several distinct interactions with the 60S surface, including a co-evolved site on neighboring RpL18. Consequently, mutational inactivation of this contact site, on either RpL4 or RpL18, impairs RpL4-Acl4 disassembly and RpL4 pre-ribosome incorporation. We propose that hierarchical ribosome assembly can be achieved by eukaryotic RP extensions and dedicated assembly chaperones. ",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal RNAs are the most abundant and universal noncoding RNAs in living organisms. In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms. However, major differences between mammalian and yeast pre-ribosomal RNA processing have recently come to light.",

We show that mammalian BCCIPβ, but not BCCIPα, forms a ternary complex with the ribosomal protein RPL23/uL14 and the pre-60S trans-acting factor eIF6. Complex formation is dependent on an intact C-terminal domain of BCCIPβ. Depletion of BCCIPβ reduces the pool of free RPL23, and decreases eIF6 levels in nucleoli. Overexpression of BCCIPβ leads to nucleoplasmic accumulation of extra-ribosomal RPL23 and stabilizes overexpressed RPL23, suggesting that BCCIPβ functions as nuclear chaperone for RPL23. ",

            "abstract": "Specific language impairment (SLI), an unexpected failure to develop appropriate language skills despite adequate non-verbal intelligence, is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder with a complex genetic basis. We identified a homozygous microdeletion of 21,379 bp in the ZNF277 gene (NM_021994.2), encompassing exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and expressive language impairment. The microdeletion was not found in the proband's affected sister or her brother who had mild language impairment. However, it was inherited from both parents, each of whom carries a heterozygous microdeletion and has a history of language problems. The microdeletion falls within the AUTS1 locus, a region linked to autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Moreover, ZNF277 is adjacent to the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been implicated in ASD. We screened for the presence of ZNF277 microdeletions in cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and panels of control subjects. ZNF277 microdeletions were at an increased allelic frequency in SLI probands (1.1%) compared with both ASD family members (0.3%) and independent controls (0.4%). We performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in individuals carrying either an IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. Although ZNF277 microdeletions reduce the expression of ZNF277, they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Conversely, IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277. We postulate that ZNF277 microdeletions may contribute to the risk of language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risk loci previously described in this region. ",

In yeast these complex particles contain four RNAs (>5400 nucleotides) and 79 different proteins. During the past 25 years, studies in yeast have led the way to understanding how these molecules are assembled into ribosomes in vivo. Assembly begins with transcription of ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus, where the RNA then undergoes complex pathways of folding, coupled with nucleotide modification, removal of spacer sequences, and binding to ribosomal proteins. More than 200 assembly factors and 76 small nucleolar RNAs transiently associate with assembling ribosomes, to enable their accurate and efficient construction. Following export of preribosomes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, they undergo final stages of maturation before entering the pool of functioning ribosomes. Elaborate mechanisms exist to monitor the formation of correct structural and functional neighborhoods within ribosomes and to destroy preribosomes that fail to assemble properly. Studies of yeast ribosome biogenesis provide useful models for ribosomopathies, diseases in humans that result from failure to properly assemble ribosomes. ",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome assembly involves a plethora of factors, which ensure that a correctly folded ribosome contains all ribosomal protein components. Among these assembly factors, Yar1 has recently emerged as a molecular chaperone for ribosomal protein rpS3 of the small ribosomal subunit (40S) in yeast. In complex with its chaperone, rpS3 is imported into the nucleus and protected from aggregation. How rpS3 and other ribosomal proteins are initially sequestered and subsequently integrated into pre-ribosomal particles is currently poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of yeast rpS3 in complex with its chaperone Yar1 at 2.8Å resolution. The crystal structure rationalizes how Yar1 can protect rpS3 from aggregation while facilitating nuclear import and suggests a mechanism for a stepwise exchange of molecular partners that ribosomal proteins interact with during ribosome assembly.

            "abstract": "Nuclear poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play key roles in eukaryotic gene expression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the major nuclear PABP, Pab2, functions in the maturation of small nucleolar RNAs as well as in nuclear RNA decay. Despite knowledge about its nuclear functions, nothing is known about how Pab2 is imported into the nucleus. Here, we show that Pab2 contains a proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) that is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization and function. Consistent with the role of karyopherin β2 (Kapβ2)-type receptors in the import of PY-NLS cargoes, we show that the fission yeast ortholog of human Kapβ2, Kap104, binds to recombinant Pab2 and is required for Pab2 nuclear localization. The absence of arginine methylation in a basic region N-terminal to the PY-core motif of Pab2 did not affect its nuclear localization. However, in the context of a sub-optimal PY-NLS, we found that Pab2 was more efficiently targeted to the nucleus in the absence of arginine methylation, suggesting that this modification can affect the import kinetics of a PY-NLS cargo. Although a sequence resembling a PY-NLS motif can be found in the human Pab2 ortholog, PABPN1, our results indicate that neither a functional PY-NLS nor Kapβ2 activity are required to promote entry of PABPN1 into the nucleus of human cells. Our findings describe the mechanism by which Pab2 is imported into the nucleus, providing the first example of a PY-NLS import system in fission yeast. In addition, this study suggests the existence of alternative or redundant nuclear import pathways for human PABPN1.",

Little is known about coordination of nucleocytoplasmic transport with ribosome assembly. Here, we identify a transport adaptor, symportin 1 (Syo1), that facilitates synchronized coimport of the two 5S-rRNA binding proteins Rpl5 and Rpl11. In vitro studies revealed that Syo1 concomitantly binds Rpl5-Rpl11 and furthermore recruits the import receptor Kap104. The Syo1-Rpl5-Rpl11 import complex is released from Kap104 by RanGTP and can be directly transferred onto the 5S rRNA. Syo1 can shuttle back to the cytoplasm by interaction with phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins. X-ray crystallography uncovered how the α-solenoid symportin accommodates the Rpl5 amino terminus, normally bound to 5S rRNA, in an extended groove. Symportin-mediated coimport of Rpl5-Rpl11 could ensure coordinated and stoichiometric incorporation of these proteins into pre-60S ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "2000 ribosomes have to be synthesized in yeast every minute. Therefore the fast production of ribosomal proteins, their efficient delivery to the nucleus and correct incorporation into ribosomal subunits are prerequisites for optimal growth rates. Here, we report that the ankyrin repeat protein Yar1 directly interacts with the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps3 and accompanies newly synthesized Rps3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where Rps3 is assembled into pre-ribosomal subunits. A yar1 deletion strain displays a similar phenotype as an rps3 mutant strain, showing an accumulation of 20S pre-rRNA and a 40S export defect. The combination of an rps3 mutation with a yar1 deletion leads to an enhancement of these phenotypes, while increased expression of RPS3 suppresses the defects of a yar1 deletion strain. We further show that Yar1 protects Rps3 from aggregation in vitro and increases its solubility in vivo. Our data suggest that Yar1 is a specific chaperone for Rps3, which serves to keep Rps3 soluble until its incorporation into the pre-ribosome.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a new technique for proximity-dependent labeling of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Named BioID for proximity-dependent biotin identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.",

Using siRNAs, we show that knockdown of 31 of the 32 ribosomal proteins of the human 40S subunit (ribosomal protein of the small subunit [RPS]) strongly affects pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, which often correlates with nucleolar chromatin disorganization. 16 RPSs are strictly required for initiating processing of the sequences flanking the 18S rRNA in the pre-rRNA except at the metazoan-specific early cleavage site. The remaining 16 proteins are necessary for progression of the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation steps and for nuclear export. Distribution of these two subsets of RPSs in the 40S subunit structure argues for a tight dependence of pre-rRNA processing initiation on the folding of both the body and the head of the forming subunit. Interestingly, the functional dichotomy of RPS proteins reported in this study is correlated with the mutation frequency of RPS genes in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role in cellular senescence as key transcriptional regulators of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus. However, how PcG complexes target and contribute to stable gene silencing of the Ink4a/Arf locus remains little understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the function of Zinc finger domain-containing protein 277 (Zfp277), a novel zinc finger protein that interacts with the PcG protein Bmi1. Zfp277 binds to the Ink4a/Arf locus in a Bmi1-independent manner and interacts with polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 1 through direct interaction with Bmi1. Loss of Zfp277 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) caused dissociation of PcG proteins from the Ink4a/Arf locus, resulting in premature senescence associated with derepressed p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) expression. Levels of both Zfp277 and PcG proteins inversely correlated with those of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in senescing MEFs, but the treatment of Zfp277(-/-) MEFs with an antioxidant restored the binding of PRC2 but not PRC1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus. Notably, forced expression of Bmi1 in Zfp277(-/-) MEFs did not restore the binding of Bmi1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus and failed to bypass cellular senescence. A Zfp277 mutant that could not bind Bmi1 did not rescue Zfp277(-/-) MEFs from premature senescence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings implicate Zfp277 in the transcriptional regulation of the Ink4a/Arf locus and suggest that the interaction of Zfp277 with Bmi1 is essential for the recruitment of PRC1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus. Our findings also highlight dynamic regulation of both Zfp277 and PcG proteins by the oxidative stress pathways.",

            "abstract": "Genes that are highly overexpressed in tumor cells can be required for tumor cell survival and have the potential to be selective therapeutic targets. In an attempt to identify such targets, we combined a functional genomics and a systems biology approach to assess the consequences of RNAi-mediated silencing of overexpressed genes that were selected from 140 gene expression profiles from colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched normal mucosa. In order to identify credible models for in-depth functional analysis, we first confirmed the overexpression of these genes in 25 different CRC cell lines. We then identified five candidate genes that profoundly reduced the viability of CRC cell lines when silenced with either siRNAs or short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), i.e., HMGA1, TACSTD2, RRM2, RPS2 and NOL5A. These genes were further studied by systematic analysis of comprehensive gene expression profiles generated following siRNA-mediated silencing. Exploration of these RNAi-specific gene expression signatures allowed the identification of the functional space in which the five genes operate and showed enrichment for cancer-specific signaling pathways, some known to be involved in CRC. By comparing the expression of the RNAi signature genes with their respective expression levels in an independent set of primary rectal carcinomas, we could recapitulate these defined RNAi signatures, therefore, establishing the biological relevance of our observations. This strategy identified the signaling pathways that are affected by the prominent oncogenes HMGA1 and TACSTD2, established a yet unknown link between RRM2 and PLK1 and identified RPS2 and NOL5A as promising potential therapeutic targets in CRC.",

Indeed, they participate in balancing the synthesis of the RNA and protein components of the ribosome itself. An exciting new story is that ribosomal proteins are sentinels for the self-evaluation of cellular health. Perturbation of ribosome synthesis frees ribosomal proteins to interface with the p53 system, leading to cell-cycle arrest or to apoptosis. Yet in only a few cases can we clearly identify the recruitment of ribosomal proteins for other extraribosomal functions. Is this due to a lack of imaginative evolution by cells and viruses, or to a lack of imaginative experiments by molecular biologists?",

We previously characterized Rmt3 as a ribosomal protein methyltransferase based on the identification of the 40 S Rps2 (ribosomal protein S2) as a substrate of Rmt3. RMT3-null cells produce nonmethylated Rps2 and show mis-regulation of the 40 S/60 S ribosomal subunit ratio due to a small subunit deficit. For this study, we have generated a series of RMT3 alleles that express various amino acid substitutions to characterize the functional domains of Rmt3 in Rps2 binding, Rps2 arginine methylation, and small ribosomal subunit production. Notably, catalytically inactive versions of Rmt3 restored the ribosomal subunit imbalance detected in RMT3-null cells. Consistent with a methyltransferase-independent function for Rmt3 in small ribosomal subunit production, the expression of an Rps2 variant in which the identified methylarginine residues were substituted with lysines showed normal levels of 40 S subunit. Importantly, substitutions within the zinc finger domain of Rmt3 that abolished Rps2 binding did not rescue the 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit of RMT3-null cells. Our findings suggest that the Rmt3-Rps2 interaction, rather than Rps2 methylation, is important for the function of Rmt3 in the regulation of small ribosomal subunit production.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A number of studies have previously shown that the over expression of different ribosomal proteins might play an important role in cancer (i.e. S3a, L10, L16). We have previously reported that RPS2, a 33 Kda ribosomal protein was over expressed in malignant prostate cancer cell lines and in archived tumor specimens. Thus, RPS2 or other aberrantly over-expressed ribosomal proteins might promote cancer and be excellent therapeutic targets for treatment of the disease. METHODS: Western blotting and RT-PCR have been used to measure and compare the levels of expression of RPS2 in a variety of malignant prostate cancer cell lines, plus normal and benign cells lines. We have developed a 'ribozyme-like' DNAZYM-1P '10-23' motif oligonucleotide and examined whether it targets RPS2 in different cell lines by RT-PCR and Western blots. Growth and apoptosis assays were carried out to measure whether DNAZYM-1P 'knock-down' of RPS2 influenced cell proliferation or survival. We have also developed a SCID mouse tumor model with PC-3ML cells to determine whether DNAZYM-1P targeting of RPS2 compromised tumor growth and mouse survival rates in vivo. RESULTS: Western blots showed that PC-3ML, LNCaP, CPTX-1532, and pBABE-cmyc stably transfected IBC-10a cells all over-expressed RPS2, whereas IBC-10a parent, NPTX-1532, and BPH-1 cells or mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressed barely detectable levels of RPS2. RT-PCR assays showed that DNAZYM-1P, which targeted RPS2, 'knocked-down' RPS2 expression in the malignant cells (i.e. PC-3ML cells) in vitro. The DNAZYM-1P also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in the malignant prostate cells, but had little effect on the normal IBC-10a or NPTX-1532 cell lines. Finally, SCID mouse tumor modeling studies showed that DNAZYM-1P blocked tumor growth and metastasis by PC-3ML cells and eventually eradicated tumors following localized or systemic i.v. delivery. Mouse survival studies revealed that there was a dosage dependent increase in disease free survival rates in mice treated systemically with DNAZYM-1P (i.e. mouse survival increased from 0% to 100%). CONCLUSION: In sum, we have shown for the first time that therapeutic targeting of RPS2 is an excellent approach for the eradication of prostate cancer in preclinical tumor modeling studies.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins have remained highly conserved during evolution presumably reflecting often critical functions in ribosome biogenesis or mature ribosome function. In addition, several ribosomal proteins possess distinct extra-ribosomal functions in apoptosis, DNA repair and transcription. An increasing number of ribosomal proteins have been shown to modulate the trans-activation function of important regulatory proteins such as NF-kappaB, p53, c-Myc and nuclear receptors. Furthermore, a subset of ribosomal proteins can bind directly to untranslated regions of mRNA resulting in transcript-specific translational control outside of the ribosome itself. Collectively, these findings suggest that ribosomal proteins may have a wider functional repertoire within the cell than previously thought. The future challenge is to identify and validate these novel functions in the background of an often essential primary function in ribosome biogenesis and cell growth.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.",

Several proteins have been shown to activate the p53 pathway by interacting with and inhibiting the E3 function of MDM2, thereby leading to an accumulation of p53. These include the alternate reading frame (ARF) proteins and the ribosomal proteins L5 and L11. We found that when overexpressed alone, L11 is much less potent in inhibiting MDM2 than p14(ARF). However, L11 cooperates with L5, resulting in a robust inhibition of the E3 activity of MDM2, and a stabilization and activation of p53 approaching that achieved by p14(ARF). We further showed that the ability of L11 to bind the 5S rRNA is important for the cooperation with L5, and a mutant L11, which cannot bind the 5S rRNA, cannot cooperate with L5 in inhibiting MDM2.",

The BiFC assay is based on the discoveries that two non-fluorescent fragments of a fluorescent protein can form a fluorescent complex and that the association of the fragments can be facilitated when they are fused to two proteins that interact with each other. BiFC must be confirmed by parallel analysis of proteins in which the interaction interface has been mutated. It is not necessary for the interaction partners to juxtapose the fragments within a specific distance of each other because they can associate when they are tethered to a complex with flexible linkers. It is also not necessary for the interaction partners to form a complex with a long half-life or a high occupancy since the fragments can associate in a transient complex and un-associated fusion proteins do not interfere with detection of the complex. Many interactions can be visualized when the fusion proteins are expressed at levels comparable to their endogenous counterparts. The BiFC assay has been used for the visualization of interactions between many types of proteins in different subcellular locations and in different cell types and organisms. It is technically straightforward and can be performed using a regular fluorescence microscope and standard molecular biology and cell culture reagents.",

Various human cancer-associated MDM2 alterations targeting the central acidic domain have been reported, yet the functional significance of these mutations in tumor development has remained unclear. Here, we show that cancer-associated missense mutations targeting MDM2's central zinc finger disrupt the interaction of MDM2 with L5 and L11. We found that the zinc finger mutant MDM2 is impaired in undergoing nuclear export and proteasomal degradation as well as in promoting p53 degradation, yet retains the function of suppressing p53 transcriptional activity. Unlike the wild-type MDM2, whose p53-suppressive activity can be inhibited by L11, the MDM2 zinc finger mutant escapes L11 inhibition. Hence, the MDM2 central zinc finger plays a critical role in mediating MDM2's interaction with ribosomal proteins and its ability to degrade p53, and these roles are disrupted by human cancer-associated MDM2 mutations.",

            "abstract": "PRMT3 (protein arginine methyltransferase 3) is one of four type I arginine methyltransferases that catalyse the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginine. PRMT3 is unique in that its N-terminus harbours a C2H2 zinc-finger domain that is proposed to confer substrate specificity. In addition, PRMT3 is the only type I enzyme that is restricted to the cytoplasm. Known in vitro substrates for PRMT3 include GST-GAR (a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the glycine- and arginine-rich N-terminal region of fibrillarin), Sam68 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis 68 kDa) and PABP-N1 [poly(A)-binding protein-N1; PABP2]. Here we report the identification of an in vivo substrate for mammalian PRMT3. We found that FLAG-tagged PRMT3 can 'pull down' a protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa from HeLa cell extracts. MS identified this PRMT3-interacting protein as rpS2 (ribosomal protein S2). In vitro studies showed that the zinc-finger domain of PRMT3 is necessary and sufficient for binding to rpS2. In addition, rpS2 is methylated by PRMT3 in vitro and is also methylated in cell lines. Deletion analysis of the rpS2 amino acid sequence identified a N-terminal Arg-Gly repeat as the methylation site. Furthermore, both PRMT3 and rpS2 co-sediment with free ribosomal subunits. These studies implicate PRMT3 in ribosomal function and in the regulation of protein synthesis.",

            "abstract": "The importance of coordinating cell growth with proliferation has been recognized for a long time. The molecular basis of this relationship, however, is poorly understood. Here we show that the ribosomal protein L23 interacts with HDM2. The interaction involves the central acidic domain of HDM2 and an N-terminal domain of L23. L23 and L11, another HDM2-interacting ribosomal protein, can simultaneously yet distinctly interact with HDM2 together to form a ternary complex. We show that, when overexpressed, L23 inhibits HDM2-induced p53 polyubiquitination and degradation and causes a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, knocking down L23 causes nucleolar stress and triggers translocation of B23 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, leading to stabilization and activation of p53. Our data suggest that cells may maintain a steady-state level of L23 during normal growth; alternating the levels of L23 in response to changing growth conditions could impinge on the HDM2-p53 pathway by interrupting the integrity of the nucleolus.",

Here we have shown that L5 also activates p53. Overexpression of L5 stabilized ectopic p53 in H1299 cells and endogenous p53 in U2OS cells. Consequently, L5 enhanced p53 transcriptional activity and induced p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, like L11 and L23, L5 also remarkably inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. The interaction of L5 with MDM2 was also enhanced by treatment with a low dose of actinomycin D. Actinomycin D-induced p53 was inhibited by small interference RNA against L5. By reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we further showed that there were at least two MDM2-ribosomal protein complexes in cells: MDM2-L5-L11-L23 and p53-MDM2-L5-L11-L23. We propose that the MDM2-L5-L11-L23 complex functions to inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and thus activates p53.",

As yet, natural substrates and cellular pathways modulated by PRMT3 remain unknown. Here, we have identified an ortholog of PRMT3 in fission yeast. Tandem affinity purification of fission yeast PRMT3 coupled with mass spectrometric protein identification revealed that PRMT3 associates with components of the translational machinery. We identified the 40S ribosomal protein S2 as the first physiological substrate of PRMT3. In addition, a fraction of yeast and human PRMT3 cosedimented with free 40S ribosomal subunits, as determined by sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation. The activity of PRMT3 is not essential since prmt3-disrupted cells are viable. Interestingly, cells lacking PRMT3 showed an accumulation of free 60S ribosomal subunits resulting in an imbalance in the 40S:60S free subunits ratio; yet pre-rRNA processing appeared to occur normally. Our results identify PRMT3 as the first type I ribosomal protein arginine methyltransferase and suggest that it regulates ribosome biosynthesis at a stage beyond pre-rRNA processing.",

A total of 10,623 predicted transcripts were isolated and screened against standard and normalized complementary DNA libraries to produce a draft map of 7048 proteins and 20,405 interactions. A computational method of rating two-hybrid interaction confidence was developed to refine this draft map to a higher confidence map of 4679 proteins and 4780 interactions. Statistical modeling of the network showed two levels of organization: a short-range organization, presumably corresponding to multiprotein complexes, and a more global organization, presumably corresponding to intercomplex connections. The network recapitulated known pathways, extended pathways, and uncovered previously unknown pathway components. This map serves as a starting point for a systems biology modeling of multicellular organisms, including humans.",

In this report, we show that the ribosomal protein L11 can interact with HDM2 and inhibit HDM2 function, thus leading to the stabilization and activation of p53. The inhibition of HDM2 activity by L11 shows some similarity to the previously described activity of ARF, and expression of either ARF or L11 can induce a p53 response. Enhancement of the interaction between endogenous L11 and HDM2 following treatment of cells with low levels of actinomycin-D suggests that the HDM2/L11 interaction represents a novel pathway for p53 stabilization in response to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.",

            "abstract": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has provided a myriad of applications for biological systems. Over the last several years, mutagenesis studies have improved folding properties of GFP (refs 1,2). However, slow maturation is still a big obstacle to the use of GFP variants for visualization. These problems are exacerbated when GFP variants are expressed at 37 degrees C and/or targeted to certain organelles. Thus, obtaining GFP variants that mature more efficiently is crucial for the development of expanded research applications. Among Aequorea GFP variants, yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are relatively acid-sensitive, and uniquely quenched by chloride ion (Cl-). For YFP to be fully and stably fluorescent, mutations that decrease the sensitivity to both pH and Cl- are desired. Here we describe the development of an improved version of YFP named \"Venus\". Venus contains a novel mutation, F46L, which at 37 degrees C greatly accelerates oxidation of the chromophore, the rate-limiting step of maturation. As a result of other mutations, F64L/M153T/V163A/S175G, Venus folds well and is relatively tolerant of exposure to acidosis and Cl-. We succeeded in efficiently targeting a neuropeptide Y-Venus fusion protein to the dense-core granules of PC12 cells. Its secretion was readily monitored by measuring release of fluorescence into the medium. The use of Venus as an acceptor allowed early detection of reliable signals of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for Ca2+ measurements in brain slices. With the improved speed and efficiency of maturation and the increased resistance to environment, Venus will enable fluorescent labelings that were not possible before.",

Forty-nine bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) genes, recently isolated by a differential screening approach of a cDNA library enriched for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) suppressed genes, were investigated. Four of these genes were finally selected because they were affected differentially by host immuno-competence, TNF-alpha, and tumor cells. Sequence analysis showed them to encode the bovine polyubiquitin (A4), elongation factor 1alpha (B2), the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (C3), and the ribosomal protein S2 (E10). Gene expression was analyzed by dot-blot or Northern blot analysis. TNF-alpha and tumor cell conditioned supernatant suppressed the genes additive in BAEC but not in other endothelial cells except for bovine capillary endothelial cells. Ex vivo-isolated liver endothelial cells of tumor-bearing syngeneic DBA/2 mice showed strong downregulation of these four genes in comparison to normal control values. In contrast, endothelial cells of tumor-bearing immuno-incompetent Balb/c (nu/nu) mice showed no downregulation but upregulation of these genes. Consistently, all four genes were also downregulated when BAEC were incubated with supernatants derived from ex vivo-isolated liver metastases from immuno-competent but not from -incompetent mice. Thus, the expression of a group of genes involved in protein translation and processing was more profoundly altered in endothelial cells in vivo than in vitro, suggesting that microenviromental factors and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions play an important role.",

We have studied this import in a mammalian system and found that the classical nuclear import pathway using the importin alpha/beta heterodimer apparently plays only a minor role. Instead, at least four importin beta-like transport receptors, namely importin beta itself, transportin, RanBP5 and RanBP7, directly bind and import ribosomal proteins. We found that the ribosomal proteins L23a, S7 and L5 can each be imported alternatively by any of the four receptors. We have studied rpL23a in detail and identified a very basic region to which each of the four import receptors bind avidly. This domain might be considered as an archetypal import signal that evolved before import receptors diverged in evolution. The presence of distinct binding sites for rpL23a and the M9 import signal in transportin, and for rpL23a and importin alpha in importin beta might explain how a single receptor can recognize very different import signals.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

            "abstract": "Despite the rising knowledge about ribosome function and structure and how ribosomal subunits assemble in vitro in bacteria, the in vivo role of many ribosomal proteins remains obscure both in pro- and eukaryotes. Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

            "abstract": "The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

            "abstract": "PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus.

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

            "abstract": "PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

            "abstract": "The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that requires ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins. Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that requires ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins. Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "Despite the rising knowledge about ribosome function and structure and how ribosomal subunits assemble in vitro in bacteria, the in vivo role of many ribosomal proteins remains obscure both in pro- and eukaryotes. Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

            "abstract": "Dedicated chaperones protect newly synthesized ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) from aggregation and accompany them on their way to assembly into nascent ribosomes. Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome production in eukaryotes requires the complex and precise coordination of several hundred assembly factors, including many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that requires ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins. Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Despite the rising knowledge about ribosome function and structure and how ribosomal subunits assemble in vitro in bacteria, the in vivo role of many ribosomal proteins remains obscure both in pro- and eukaryotes. Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

            "abstract": "PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

            "abstract": "The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

            "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes.

            "abstract": "Dedicated chaperones protect newly synthesized ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) from aggregation and accompany them on their way to assembly into nascent ribosomes. Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",

Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA(2) pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A(2) within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion-induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein. Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits, which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.",

Our systematic analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis, making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.",

Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277-uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277-uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.",

This WD-repeat β-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring C-terminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1Δ strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

However, at present, the distinct role of key snoRNAs in ribosome biogenesis remains poorly understood in higher plants. Here we report that a previously uncharacterized C (RUGAUGA)/D (CUGA) type snoRNA, HIDDEN TREASURE 2 (HID2), acts as an important regulator of ribosome biogenesis through a snoRNA-rRNA interaction. Nucleolus-localized HID2 is actively expressed in Arabidopsis proliferative tissues, whereas defects in HID2 cause a series of developmental defects reminiscent of ribosomal protein mutants. HID2 associates with the precursor 45S rRNA and promotes the efficiency and accuracy of pre-rRNA processing. Intriguingly, disrupting HID2 in Arabidopsis appears to impair the integrity of 27SB, a key pre-rRNA intermediate that generates 25S and 5.8S rRNA and is known to be vital for the synthesis of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and also produces an imbalanced ribosome profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the antisense-box of HID2 is both functionally essential and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Overall, our study reveals the vital and possibly conserved role of a snoRNA in monitoring the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.",
