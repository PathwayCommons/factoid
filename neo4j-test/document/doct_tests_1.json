            "Abstract": "Kindler syndrome is an autosomal recessive genodermatosis that results from mutations in the FERMT1 gene encoding t kindlin-1. Kindlin-1 localizes to focal adhesion and is known to contribute to the activation of integrin receptors. Most cases of Kindler syndrome show a reduction or complete absence of kindlin-1 in keratinocytes, resulting in defective integrin activation, cell adhesion, and migration. However, roles for kindlin-1 beyond integrin activation remain poorly defined. In this study we show that skin and keratinocytes from Kindler syndrome patients have significantly reduced expression levels of the EGFR, resulting in defective EGF-dependent signaling and cell migration. Mechanistically, we show that kindlin-1 can associate directly with EGFR in vitro and in keratinocytes in an EGF-dependent, integrin-independent manner and that formation of this complex is required for EGF-dependent migration. We further show that kindlin-1 acts to protect EGFR from lysosomal-mediated degradation. This shows a new role for kindlin-1 that has implications for understanding Kindler syndrome disease pathology.",

            "abstract": "MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a frequently used method for the quantitative characterization of intermolecular interactions with several advantages over other technologies. One of these is its capability to determine equilibrium constants in solution including complex biological matrices such as cell lysates. MST requires one binding partner to be fluorescent, which is typically achieved by labeling target proteins with a suitable fluorophore. Here, we present a near-native, site-specific in situ labeling strategy for MST experiments that enables reliable measurements in cell lysates and that has distinct advantages over routine covalent labeling techniques. To this end, we exploited the high-affinity interaction of tris-NTA with oligohistidine-tags, which are popular for purification, immobilization or detection of recombinant proteins. We used various DYE-tris-NTA conjugates to successfully label His-tagged proteins that were either purified or a component of cell lysate. The RED-tris-NTA was identified as the optimal dye conjugate with a high affinity towards oligohistidine-tags, a high fluorescence signal and an optimal signal-to-noise ratio in MST binding experiments. Owing to its emission in the red region of the spectrum, it also enables reliable measurements in complex biological matrices such as cell lysates allowing a more physiologically realistic assessment and eliminating the need for protein purification.",

            "abstract": "When cell surface receptors engage their cognate ligands in the extracellular space, they become competent to transmit potent signals to the inside of the cell, thereby instigating growth, differentiation, motility and many other processes. In order to control these signals, activated receptors are endocytosed and thoroughly curated by the endosomal network of intracellular vesicles and proteolytic organelles. In this Review, we follow the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) from ligand engagement, through its voyage on endosomes and, ultimately, to its destruction in the lysosome. We focus on the spatial and temporal considerations underlying the molecular decisions that govern this complex journey and discuss how additional cellular organelles - particularly the ER - play active roles in the regulation of receptor lifespan. In summarizing the functions of relevant molecules on the endosomes and the ER, we cover the order of molecular events in receptor activation, trafficking and downregulation, and provide an overview of how signaling is controlled at the interface between these organelles.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT1. This gene encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in activation of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and migration. Electric fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin-1 but not a W612A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin-1 was also required for the maintenance of lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin-1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology.",

            "abstract": "The kindlin (or fermitin) family of proteins comprises three members (kindlin-1,-2 and -3) of evolutionarily conserved focal adhesion (FA) proteins, whose best-known task is to increase integrin affinity for a ligand (also referred as integrin activation) through binding of β-integrin tails. The consequence of kindlin-mediated integrin activation and integrin-ligand binding is cell adhesion, spreading and migration, assembly of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Another hallmark of kindlins is their involvement in disease. Mutations in the KINDLIN-1 (also known as FERMT1) gene cause Kindler syndrome (KS)--in which mainly skin and intestine are affected, whereas mutations in the KINDLIN-3 (also known as FERMT3) gene cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III (LAD III), which is characterized by impaired extravasation of blood effector cells and severe, spontaneous bleedings. Also, aberrant expression of kindlins in various forms of cancer and in tissue fibrosis has been reported. Although the malfunctioning of integrins represent a major cause leading to kindlin-associated diseases, increasing evidence also point to integrin-independent functions of kindlins that play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain disease aspects. Furthermore, isoform-specific kindlin functions have been discovered, explaining, for example, why loss of kindlins differentially affects tissue stem cell homeostasis or tumor development. This Commentary focuses on new and isoform-specific kindlin functions in different tissues and discusses their potential role in disease development and progression.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we report that Src binds to and phosphorylates Kindlin-2 at Y193. Reciprocally, Kindlin-2-Y193 phosphorylation activates and maintains Src kinase activity. Kindlin-2-Y193 phosphorylation is also involved in its binding capacity with Migfilin and the recruitment of Migfilin to the focal adhesions. Functionally, we demonstrate that Kindlin-2-Y193 phosphorylation regulates Kindlin-2-mediated cell spreading and migration. These findings suggest that Src, Kindlin-2 and Migfilin together constitute a positive feedback loop that controls Src activity and regulates integrin-mediated cellular functions. ",

Kindlin-2 has been known as a focal adhesion molecule that binds to integrin to control cell migration and invasion. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Kindlin-2 in breast cancer progression remain elusive. Here we report that Kindlin-2 interacts with EGFR and mediates EGF-induced breast cancer cell migration. We found that EGF treatment dramatically increases Kindlin-2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a variety of cancer cells. Inhibitors specific for EGFR or PI3K blocked Kindlin-2 induction by EGF. Importantly, Kindlin-2 interacted with EGFR kinase domain, which was independent of Kindlin-2 binding to integrin cytoplasmic domain. Intriguingly, Kindlin-2 stabilized EGFR protein by blocking its ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of Kindlin-2 impaired EGF-induced cell migration. Our results demonstrated that Kindlin-2 participates in EGFR signaling and regulates breast cancer progression. ",

Here we show that depletion of kindlin-2 impairs integrin outside-in signaling. Kindlin-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell-ECM adhesion. Furthermore, kindlin-2 binds Src in a cell-ECM adhesion-regulatable fashion. At the molecular level, the kindlin-2·Src interaction is mediated by the kindlin-2 F0 and the Src SH2 and SH3 domains. Src activation increases kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and the kindlin-2·Src interaction. Conversely, inhibition of Src reduces kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and diminishes the kindlin-2·Src interaction. Finally, disruption of the kindlin-2·Src interaction, unlike depletion of kindlin-2, impairs neither cell-ECM adhesion nor cell-ECM adhesion-induced focal adhesion kinase Tyr-397 phosphorylation. However, it markedly inhibits cell-ECM adhesion-induced paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, cell migration, and proliferation. These results suggest that kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with Src serve as a regulatable switch downstream of focal adhesion kinase in the integrin outside-in signaling circuit, relaying signals from cell-ECM adhesion to paxillin that control cell migration and proliferation.

            "abstract": "Kindlins are essential FERM-domain-containing focal adhesion (FA) proteins required for proper integrin activation and signaling. Despite the widely accepted importance of each of the three mammalian kindlins in cell adhesion, the molecular basis for their function has yet to be fully elucidated, and the functional differences between isoforms have generally not been examined. Here, we report functional differences between kindlin-2 and -3 (also known as FERMT2 and FERMT3, respectively); GFP-tagged kindlin-2 localizes to FAs whereas kindlin-3 does not, and kindlin-2, but not kindlin-3, can rescue α5β1 integrin activation defects in kindlin-2-knockdown fibroblasts. Using chimeric kindlins, we show that the relatively uncharacterized kindlin-2 F2 subdomain drives FA targeting and integrin activation. We find that the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-PINCH-parvin complex binds strongly to the kindlin-2 F2 subdomain but poorly to that of kindlin-3. Using a point-mutated kindlin-2, we establish that efficient kindlin-2-mediated integrin activation and FA targeting require binding to the ILK complex. Thus, ILK-complex binding is crucial for normal kindlin-2 function and differential ILK binding contributes to kindlin isoform specificity. ",

Aberrant EGFR signaling has been reported in inflammatory and malignant diseases, but thus far no primary inherited defects in EGFR have been recorded. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in EGFR (c.1283 G>A; p.Gly428Asp) in a male infant with lifelong inflammation affecting the skin, bowel, and lungs. During the first year of life, his skin showed erosions, dry scale, and alopecia. Subsequently, there were numerous papules and pustules--similar to the rash seen in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor drugs. Skin biopsy demonstrated an altered cellular distribution of EGFR in the epidermis with reduced cell membrane labeling, and in vitro analysis of the mutant receptor revealed abrogated EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream signaling. Microarray analysis on the patient's skin highlighted disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and upregulation of several inflammatory/innate immune response networks. The boy died at the age of 2.5 years from extensive skin and chest infections as well as electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues.",

Pixel-wise colocalization analyses, however, are not always suitable, because they do not provide object-specific information, and they are vulnerable to noise and background fluorescence. Here we present a versatile protocol for a method named 'Squassh' (segmentation and quantification of subcellular shapes), which is used for detecting, delineating and quantifying subcellular structures in fluorescence microscopy images. The workflow is implemented in freely available, user-friendly software. It works on both 2D and 3D images, accounts for the microscope optics and for uneven image background, computes cell masks and provides subpixel accuracy. The Squassh software enables both colocalization and shape analyses. The protocol can be applied in batch, on desktop computers or computer clusters, and it usually requires <1 min and <5 min for 2D and 3D images, respectively. Basic computer-user skills and some experience with fluorescence microscopy are recommended to successfully use the protocol. ",

This polarized epithelium is composed of biochemically and functionally separate apical and basolateral surfaces. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of epithelial homeostasis and is perturbed in a number of epithelial disorders. It is underappreciated that in vivo EGFR signaling is most often initiated by cell-surface delivery and processing of one of seven transmembrane ligands, resulting in release of the soluble form that binds EGFR. In polarized epithelial cells, EGFR is restricted largely to the basolateral surface, and apical or basolateral ligand delivery therefore has important biological consequences. In vitro approaches have been used to study the biosynthesis, cell-surface delivery, proteolytic processing, and release of soluble EGFR ligands in polarized epithelial cells. We review these results, discuss their relevance to normal physiology, and demonstrate the pathophysiological consequences of aberrant trafficking. These studies have uncovered a rich diversity of apico-basolateral trafficking mechanisms among the EGFR ligands, provided insights into the pathogenesis of an inherited magnesium-wasting disorder of the kidney (isolated renal hypomagnesemia), and identified a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes.

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs), sites of tight adhesion to the extracellular matrix, are composed of clusters of transmembrane integrin adhesion receptors and intracellular proteins that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways. Two integrin-binding proteins present in FAs, kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, are important for integrin activation, FA formation, and signaling. Migfilin, originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for kindlin-2-interacting proteins, is a LIM domain-containing adaptor protein found in FAs and implicated in control of cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. By binding filamin, migfilin provides a link between kindlin and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, using a combination of kindlin knockdown, biochemical pulldown assays, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we have established that the C-terminal LIM domains of migfilin dictate its FA localization, shown that these domains mediate an interaction with kindlin in vitro and in cells, and demonstrated that kindlin is important for normal migfilin dynamics in cells. We also show that when the C-terminal LIM domain region is deleted, then the N-terminal filamin-binding region of the protein, which is capable of targeting migfilin to actin-rich stress fibers, is the predominant driver of migfilin localization. Our work details a correlation between migfilin domains that drive kindlin binding and those that drive FA localization as well as a kindlin dependence on migfilin FA recruitment and mobility. We therefore suggest that the kindlin interaction with migfilin LIM domains drives migfilin FA recruitment, localization, and mobility. ",

            "abstract": "Proteins of the 4.1 family are characteristic of eumetazoan organisms. Invertebrates contain single 4.1 genes and the Drosophila model suggests that 4.1 is essential for animal life. Vertebrates have four paralogues, known as 4.1R, 4.1N, 4.1G and 4.1B, which are additionally duplicated in the ray-finned fish. Protein 4.1R was the first to be discovered: it is a major mammalian erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein, essential to the mechanochemical properties of red cell membranes because it promotes the interaction between spectrin and actin in the membrane cytoskeleton. 4.1R also binds certain phospholipids and is required for the stable cell surface accumulation of a number of erythrocyte transmembrane proteins that span multiple functional classes; these include cell adhesion molecules, transporters and a chemokine receptor. The vertebrate 4.1 proteins are expressed in most tissues, and they are required for the correct cell surface accumulation of a very wide variety of membrane proteins including G-Protein coupled receptors, voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels, as well as the classes identified in erythrocytes. Indeed, such large numbers of protein interactions have been mapped for mammalian 4.1 proteins, most especially 4.1R, that it appears that they can act as hubs for membrane protein organization. The range of critical interactions of 4.1 proteins is reflected in disease relationships that include hereditary anaemias, tumour suppression, control of heartbeat and nervous system function. The 4.1 proteins are defined by their domain structure: apart from the spectrin/actin-binding domain they have FERM and FERM-adjacent domains and a unique C-terminal domain. Both the FERM and C-terminal domains can bind transmembrane proteins, thus they have the potential to be cross-linkers for membrane proteins. The activity of the FERM domain is subject to multiple modes of regulation via binding of regulatory ligands, phosphorylation of the FERM associated domain and differential mRNA splicing. Finally, the spectrum of interactions of the 4.1 proteins overlaps with that of another membrane-cytoskeleton linker, ankyrin. Both ankyrin and 4.1 link to the actin cytoskeleton via spectrin, and we hypothesize that differential regulation of 4.1 proteins and ankyrins allows highly selective control of cell surface protein accumulation and, hence, function. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Reciprocal influences between cell cytoskeleton and membrane channels, receptors and transporters. Guest Editor: Jean Claude Hervé ",

            "abstract": "Ligand-induced internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important process for regulating signal transduction, cellular dynamics, and cell-cell communication. Here, we demonstrate that nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is required for the internalization of the EGFR and to trigger the EGFR-dependent activation of ERK and AKT. The EGFR was identified as a protein that interacts with NM II by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. This interaction requires both the regulatory light chain 20 (RLC20) of NM II and the kinase domain of the EGFR. Two paralogs of NM II, NM II-A, and NM II-B can act to internalize the EGFR, depending on the cell type and paralog content of the cell line. Loss (siRNA) or inhibition (25 μm blebbistatin) of NM II attenuates the internalization of the EGFR and impairs EGFR-dependent activation of ERK and AKT. Both internalization of the EGFR and downstream signaling to ERK and AKT can be partially restored in siRNA-treated cells by introduction of wild type (WT) GFP-NM II, but cannot be restored by motor mutant NM II. Taken together, these results suggest that NM II plays a role in the internalization of the EGFR and EGFR-mediated signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Fascin is an evolutionarily conserved actin-binding protein that plays a key role in forming filopodia. It is widely thought that this function involves fascin directly bundling actin filaments, which is controlled by an N-terminal regulatory serine residue. In this paper, by studying cellular processes in Drosophila melanogaster that require fascin activity, we identify a regulatory residue within the C-terminal region of the protein (S289). Unexpectedly, although mutation (S289A) of this residue disrupted the actin-bundling capacity of fascin, fascin S289A fully rescued filopodia formation in fascin mutant flies. Live imaging of migrating macrophages in vivo revealed that this mutation restricted the localization of fascin to the distal ends of filopodia. The corresponding mutation of human fascin (S274) similarly affected its interaction with actin and altered filopodia dynamics within carcinoma cells. These data reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for this regulatory region and unveil a function for fascin, uncoupled from actin bundling, at the distal end of filopodia.",

A 52-actuator deformable mirror is used to both correct aberrations and induce two-dimensional astigmatism in the point-spread-function. The dependence of the z-localization precision on the degree of astigmatism is discussed. We achieve a z-localization precision of 40 nm for fluorescent proteins and 20 nm for fluorescent dyes, over an axial depth of ~800 nm. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach for three-dimensional high-resolution microscopy with super-resolution images of actin filaments in fixed cells and single-molecule tracking of quantum-dot labeled transmembrane proteins in live HeLa cells.",

Talin is abundant in the cytosol; however, it mediates adhesion by associating with integrins in the plasma membrane where it forms a primary link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells modulate the partitioning of talin between the plasma membrane and the cytosol to control cell adhesion. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or its localization to the plasma membrane. An interaction between a discrete vinculin-binding region of the rod (VBS1/2a; Tln1(482-787)), and the THD restrains talin from interacting with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that vinculin binding to VBS1/2a results in talin recruitment to the plasma membrane. Thus, we have structurally defined specific inter-domain interactions between THD and the talin rod domain that regulate the subcellular localization of talin.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-β1-null keratinocytes can adhere to fibronectin through integrin αvβ6, but form large peripheral focal adhesions and exhibit defective cell spreading. Here we report that, in addition to the reduced avidity of αvβ6 integrin binding to fibronectin, the inability of integrin β6 to efficiently bind and recruit kindlin-2 to focal adhesions directly contributes to these phenotypes. Kindlins regulate integrins through direct interactions with the integrin-β cytoplasmic tail and keratinocytes express kindlin-1 and kindlin-2. Notably, although both kindlins localize to focal adhesions in wild-type cells, only kindlin-1 localizes to the integrin-β6-rich adhesions of integrin-β1-null cells. Rescue of these cells with wild-type and chimeric integrin constructs revealed a correlation between kindlin-2 recruitment and cell spreading. Furthermore, despite the presence of kindlin-1, knockdown of kindlin-2 in wild-type keratinocytes impaired cell spreading. Our data reveal unexpected functional consequences of differences in the association of two homologous kindlin isoforms with two closely related integrins, and suggest that despite their similarities, different kindlins are likely to have unique functions.",

            "abstract": "The activation of heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors from low to high affinity states occurs in response to intracellular signals that act on the short cytoplasmic tails of integrin β subunits. Binding of the talin FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain to the integrin β tail provides one key activation signal, but recent data indicate that the kindlin family of FERM domain proteins also play a central role. Kindlins directly bind integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains at a site distinct from the talin-binding site, and target to focal adhesions in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which kindlins impact integrin activation remain largely unknown. A notable feature of kindlins is their similarity to the integrin-binding and activating talin FERM domain. Drawing on this similarity, here we report the identification of an unstructured insert in the kindlin F1 FERM domain, and provide evidence that a highly conserved polylysine motif in this loop supports binding to negatively charged phospholipid head groups. We further show that the F1 loop and its membrane-binding motif are required for kindlin-1 targeting to focal adhesions, and for the cooperation between kindlin-1 and -2 and the talin head in αIIbβ3 integrin activation, but not for kindlin binding to integrin β tails. These studies highlight the structural and functional similarities between kindlins and the talin head and indicate that as for talin, FERM domain interactions with acidic membrane phospholipids as well β-integrin tails contribute to the ability of kindlins to activate integrins.",

Herein we review the clinical and genetic data of 62 patients, and delineate the natural history of the disorder, for example, age at onset of symptoms, or risk of malignancy. Although most mutations are predicted to lead to premature termination of translation, and to loss of kindlin-1 function, significant clinical variability is observed among patients. There is an association of FERMT1 missense and in-frame deletion mutations with milder disease phenotypes, and later onset of complications. Nevertheless, the clinical variability is not fully explained by genotype-phenotype correlations. Environmental factors and yet unidentified modifiers may play a role. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of KS should enable the development of prevention strategies for disease complications.",

Fewer than 100 cases have been described in the literature. First reported in 1954, the molecular basis of Kindler syndrome was elucidated in 2003 with the discovery of FERMT1 (KIND1) loss-of-function mutations in affected individuals. The FERMT1 gene encodes kindlin-1 (also known as fermitin family homologue 1), a 77 kDa protein that localizes at focal adhesions, where it plays an important role in integrin signalling.

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "Integrin activation is crucial for numerous cellular responses, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Recent studies in mice have specifically emphasized the vital role of kindlin-3 in integrin activation. Kindlin-3 deficiency in humans also has now been documented and includes symptoms of bleeding, frequent infections, and osteopetrosis, which are consequences of an inability to activate beta1, beta2, and beta3 integrins. To date, kindlin-3 was thought to be restricted to hematopoietic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that kindlin-3 is present in human endothelial cells derived from various anatomical origins. The mRNA and protein for KINDLIN-3 was detected in endothelial cells by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blots. When subjected to sequencing by mass spectrometry, the protein was identified as authentic kindlin-3 and unequivocally distinguished from KINDLIN-1 and KINDLIN-2 or any other known protein. By quantitative real time PCR, the level of kindlin-3 in endothelial cells was 20-50% of that of kindlin-2. Using knockdown approaches, we show that kindlin-3 plays a role in integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells. This function depends upon the integrin and substrate and is distinct from that of kindlin-2. Formation of tube-like structures in Matrigel also was impaired by kindlin-3 knockdown. Mechanistically, the distinct functions of the kindlins can be traced to differences in their subcellular localization in integrin-containing adhesion structures. Thus, the prevailing view that individual kindlins exert their functions in a cell type-specific manner must now be modified to consider distinct functions of the different family members within the same cell type.",

            "abstract": "The integrin family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules exists in both low- and high-affinity states, and integrin activation requires binding of the talin FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain to membrane-proximal sequences in the beta-integrin cytoplasmic domain. However, it has recently become apparent that the kindlin family of FERM domain proteins is also essential for talin-induced integrin activation. FERM domains are typically composed of F1, F2, and F3 domains, but the talin FERM domain is atypical in that it contains a large insert in F1 and is preceded by a previously unrecognized domain, F0. Initial sequence alignments showed that the kindlin FERM domain was most similar to the talin FERM domain, but the homology appeared to be restricted to the F2 and F3 domains. Based on a detailed characterization of the talin FERM domain, we have reinvestigated the sequence relationship with kindlins and now show that kindlins do indeed contain the same domain structure as the talin FERM domain. However, the kindlin F1 domain contains an even larger insert than that in talin F1 that disrupts the sequence alignment. The insert, which varies in length between different kindlins, is not conserved and, as in talin, is largely unstructured. We have determined the structure of the kindlin-1 F0 domain by NMR, which shows that it adopts the same ubiquitin-like fold as the talin F0 and F1 domains. Comparison of the kindlin-1 and talin F0 domains identifies the probable interface with the kindlin-1 F1 domain. Potential sites of interaction of kindlin F0 with other proteins are discussed, including sites that differ between kindlin-1, kindlin-2, and kindlin-3. We also demonstrate that F0 is required for the ability of kindlin-1 to support talin-induced alphaIIbbeta3 integrin activation and for the localization of kindlin-1 to focal adhesions.",

Moreover, they have also been linked to inherited and acquired human diseases including Kindler syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, and cancer. Although most studies have focused on kindlins as key regulatory components of cell-extracellular matrix junctions such as focal adhesions, preliminary data suggest the involvement of additional cellular compartments in mediating their functions, particularly at cell-cell contacts and the nucleus. Investigating the many roles of kindlins is likely to expand and sharpen our view on the versatility of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, the nuclear function of focal adhesion proteins, and the crosstalk between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions in health and disease.",

Although Kindler syndrome is classified as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, it has distinct clinicopathological and molecular abnormalities. The molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in a newly recognized actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, now known as fermitin family homologue 1, encoded by the gene FERMT1. This protein mediates anchorage between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions, and thus the structural pathology differs from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa in which there is a disruption of the keratin intermediate filament-hemidesmosome network and the extracellular matrix. In the skin, fermitin family homologue 1 is mainly expressed in basal keratinocytes and binds to the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 and beta3 integrins as well as to fermitin family homologue 2 and filamin-binding LIM protein 1. It also plays a crucial role in keratinocyte migration, proliferation and adhesion. In this report, we review the clinical, cellular and molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome and discuss the role of fermitin family homologue 1 in keratinocyte biology.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-mediated cell-ECM (extracellular matrix) adhesion is a fundamental process that controls cell behaviour. For correct cell-ECM adhesion, both the ligand-binding affinity and the spatial organization of integrins must be precisely controlled; how integrins are regulated, however, is not completely understood. Kindlins constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic components of cell-ECM adhesions that bind to beta-integrin cytoplasmic tails directly and cooperate with talin in integrin activation. In addition, kindlins interact with many components of cell-ECM adhesions--such as migfilin and integrin-linked kinase--to promote cytoskeletal reorganization. Loss of kindlins causes severe defects in integrin signalling, cell-ECM adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, resulting in early embryonic lethality (kindlin-2), postnatal lethality (kindlin-3) and Kindler syndrome (kindlin-1). It is therefore clear that kindlins, together with several other integrin-proximal proteins, are essential for integrin signalling and cell-ECM adhesion regulation.",

Loss of kindlin-1 leads to abnormalities of cell adhesion and motility, and to skin blistering and progressive poikiloderma as clinical symptoms. OBJECTIVES: Here we investigated a severely affected patient, disclosed the mutation that caused the disease and delineated its biological consequences. METHODS: Mutation screening of the kindlin-1 gene, KIND1 (now called FERMT1), was performed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all exons and sequencing. Mutated kindlin-1 was characterized by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunoblotting, and genotype-phenotype correlations were analysed using immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsies and keratinocytes from the patient's skin. Cell adhesion and motility were assessed with functional tests. RESULTS: We disclosed a splice site mutation in the first position of intron 13 of the FERMT1 gene, which caused skipping of exon 13. The short transcript partially escaped nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and was translated into a truncated protein. CONCLUSION: A C-terminally truncated kindlin-1 in keratinocytes could not function correctly even if it were expressed.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) results from pathogenic loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, which encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton-related protein. How and why abnormalities in kindlin-1 disrupt keratinocyte cell biology in KS, however, is not yet known. In this study, we identified two previously unreported binding proteins of kindlin-1: kindlin-2 and migfilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies show that these three proteins bind to each other and colocalize at focal adhesion in HaCaT cells and normal human keratinocytes. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in KIND1 result in marked variability in kindlin-1 immunolabeling in KS skin, which is mirrored by similar changes in kindlin-2 and migfilin immunoreactivity. Kindlin-1, however, may function independently of kindlin-2 and migfilin, as loss of kindlin-1 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes by RNA interference and in KS keratinocytes does not affect KIND2 or FBLIM1 (migfilin) gene expression or kindlin-2 and migfilin protein localization. In addition to identifying protein-binding partners for kindlin-1, this study also highlights that KIND1 gene expression and kindlin-1 protein labeling are not always reduced in KS, findings that are relevant to the accurate laboratory diagnosis of this genodermatosis by skin immunohistochemistry.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association of aggressive periodontitis with Kindler syndrome was based on a single case in 1996 and later confirmed with a larger population. Since then, significant research has greatly increased our understanding of the molecular pathology of this disorder. We review recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of the syndrome and present a maintenance case report of a patient who has been followed in our clinic. METHODS: A female patient who was diagnosed with Kindler syndrome and aggressive periodontitis at the age of 16 years has been followed and treated in our clinic for 12 years. Her main treatment has been maintenance therapy following her initial treatment and restorative work previously documented. Gingival biopsies obtained during the recent extraction of hopeless maxillary molars were used for histologic assessment of gingival tissue attachment apparatus and to isolate gingival fibroblasts. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using these cells to confirm the lack of expression of kindlin-1. RESULTS: RT-PCR showed the total loss of kindlin-1 mRNA in cultured gingival fibroblasts, supporting the clinical diagnosis of Kindler syndrome. Tissue biopsies revealed atypical pocket epithelium. Maintenance therapy has been moderately successful. Teeth that were recently lost had a poor prognosis at the initial assessment. The patient's gingiva and oral mucosa continue to be fragile with episodes of sloughing and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis in Kindler syndrome responds to maintenance therapy, but the gingiva and oral mucosa continue to display an abnormal appearance with white patches. Histologic findings suggest that the junctional epithelium in Kindler syndrome may be abnormal and could explain why these patients have periodontal disease. Attachment loss progressed around teeth with an initial guarded or poor prognosis. Teeth that started with a good or fair prognosis continue to have a fair prognosis. Limited dental implant treatment is being considered.",

            "abstract": "Here, we report a direct interaction between the beta1 integrin cytoplasmic tail and Rab25, a GTPase that has been linked to tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Rab25 promotes a mode of migration on 3D matrices that is characterized by the extension of long pseudopodia, and the association of the GTPase with alpha5beta1 promotes localization of vesicles that deliver integrin to the plasma membrane at pseudopodial tips as well as the retention of a pool of cycling alpha5beta1 at the cell front. Furthermore, Rab25-driven tumor-cell invasion into a 3D extracellular matrix environment is strongly dependent on ligation of fibronectin by alpha5beta1 integrin and the capacity of Rab25 to interact with beta1 integrin. These data indicate that Rab25 contributes to tumor progression by directing the localization of integrin-recycling vesicles and thereby enhancing the ability of tumor cells to invade the extracellular matrix.",

Deficiency of kindlin-1, as a result of loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, causes Kindler syndrome, an autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by skin blistering, progressive skin atrophy, photosensitivity and, occasionally, carcinogenesis. Here we characterized authentic and recombinantly expressed kindlin-1 and show that it is localized in basal epidermal keratinocytes in a polar fashion, close to the cell surface facing the basement membrane, in the areas between the hemidesmosomes. We identified two forms of kindlin-1 in keratinocytes, with apparent molecular masses of 78 and 74 kDa, corresponding to phosphorylated and desphosphorylated forms of the protein. In kindlin-1-deficient skin, basal keratinocytes show multiple abnormalities: cell polarity is lost, proliferation is strongly reduced, and several cells undergo apoptosis. In vitro, deficiency of kindlin-1 in keratinocytes leads to strongly reduced cell proliferation, decreased adhesion, undirected motility, and intense protrusion activity of the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results show that kindlin-1 plays a role in keratinocyte adhesion, polarization, proliferation, and migration. It is involved in organization and anchorage of the actin cytoskeleton to integrin-associated signaling platforms.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive skin fragility disorder characterized by blistering in infancy, followed by photosensitivity and progressive poikiloderma. Ultrastructural examination reveals marked basement membrane reduplication and variable levels of cleavage at the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular pathology underlying Kindler syndrome has recently been shown to involve loss-of-function mutations in a novel gene, KIND1, encoding kindlin-1. Immunofluorescence, gene expression and cell biology studies have shown that kindlin-1 is expressed mainly in basal keratinocytes and plays a role in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton via focal contacts to the extracellular matrix. Thus, Kindler syndrome is the first genodermatosis caused by a defect in actin-extracellular matrix linkage rather than the classic keratin-extracellular matrix linkage underlying the pathology of other inherited skin fragility disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa. This article reviews the clinical features as well as the molecular and cellular pathology of Kindler syndrome and highlights the importance of the new protein, kindlin-1, in cell-matrix adhesion and its intriguing link to photosensitivity.",

Linkage and homozygosity analysis in an isolated Panamanian cohort and in additional inbred families mapped the gene to 20p12.3. Loss-of-function mutations were identified in the FLJ20116 gene (renamed \"KIND1\" [encoding kindlin-1]). Kindlin-1 is a human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-112, a membrane-associated structural/signaling protein that has been implicated in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, Kindler syndrome is, to our knowledge, the first skin fragility disorder caused by a defect in actin-ECM linkage, rather than keratin-ECM linkage.",

Overexpression studies have identified Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation of EGFR as a mechanism of ligand-induced EGFR down-regulation. However, the role of endogenous Cbl in EGFR down-regulation and the precise step in the endocytic pathway regulated by Cbl remain unclear. Using Cbl-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, we demonstrate that endogenous Cbl is essential for ligand-induced ubiquitinylation and efficient degradation of EGFR. Further analyses using Chinese hamster ovary cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitinylation confirm a crucial role of the ubiquitin machinery in Cbl-mediated EGFR degradation. However, internalization into early endosomes did not require Cbl function or an intact ubiquitin pathway. Confocal immunolocalization studies indicated that Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation plays a critical role at the early endosome to late endosome/lysosome sorting step of EGFR down-regulation. These findings establish Cbl as the major endogenous ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGFR degradation, and show that the critical role of Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is at the level of endosomal sorting, rather than at the level of internalization.",

            "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily and is involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and motility. Growth factor binding induces receptor oligomerization at the plasma membrane, which leads to activation of the intrinsic RTK activity and trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of the receptor. These residues are docking sites for proteins containing Src homology domain 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains that relay the signal inside the cell. In response to EGF attached to beads, lateral propagation of EGFR phosphorylation occurs at the plasma membrane, representing an early amplification step in EGFR signalling. Here we have investigated an underlying reaction network that couples RTK activity to protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibition by reactive oxygen species. Mathematical analysis of the chemical kinetic equations of the minimal reaction network detects general properties of this system that can be observed experimentally by imaging EGFR phosphorylation in cells. The existence of a bistable state in this reaction network explains a threshold response and how a high proportion of phosphorylated receptors can be maintained in plasma membrane regions that are not exposed to ligand.",

We report the localization to chromosome 20p12.3 by homozygosity mapping and the identification of a new gene, which we propose to name kindlerin. We found four different homozygous mutations in four consanguineous families from North Africa and Senegal; three are expected to lead to premature stop codons and truncated proteins and the fourth involves a splice site. We were unable to identify a mutation in kindlerin in a fifth consanguineous family from Algeria with a similar phenotype and in which the patient was homozygous for the markers in the 20p12.3 interval. The kindlerin protein contains several domains which are shared by a diverse group of peripheral membrane proteins that function as membrane-cytoskeleton linkers: two regions homologous to band 4.1 domain of which one includes a FERM domain with a NPKY sequence motif, and a third region with a PH or pleckstrin homology domain. Kindlerin might be involved in the bidirectional signaling between integrin molecules in the membrane and the cytoskeleton, and could be involved in cell adhesion processes via integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT1. This gene encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in activation of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and migration. Electric fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin-1 but not a W612A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin-1 was also required for the maintenance of lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin-1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology.",

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is an adaptor protein that is expressed by most epithelial cells and has been implicated in integrin bidirectional signaling. Mutations in the gene encoding kindlin-1 are associated with Kindler syndrome, a recessively inherited disorder that is characterized by fragile skin. Functionally, a loss of kindlin-1 impairs the adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the extracellular matrix both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we show that the phenotype of mutant keratinocytes deficient in kindlin-1 is characterized by the modification of the cortical actin network and increased plasticity of the plasma membrane. At the molecular level, expression of several proteins associated with an epithelial phenotype, such as α6β4 integrin, collagen XVII, E-cadherin, and desmoglein-3, is strongly reduced, whereas, surprisingly, laminin 332 is synthesized in larger amounts than in control keratinocytes. In contrast, mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin are increased in keratinocytes lacking kindlin-1. The switch in cell plasticity and protein expression was confirmed by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of kindlin-1 in HaCaT epithelial cells. Furthermore, there was up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines in kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes. These results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that take place in Kindler syndrome. Moreover, the constellation of molecular defects associated with the loss of kindlin-1 may explain the higher incidence of skin cancer observed in patients affected with this disorder.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Kindler syndrome (KS) have loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene that encodes the focal adhesion component kindlin-1. The major clinical manifestation of KS is epidermal atrophy (premature skin ageing). This phenotypic feature is thought to be related to the decreased proliferation rate of KS keratinocytes; nevertheless, molecular mediators of such abnormal behaviour have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how kindlin-1 deficiency affects the proliferative potential of primary human keratinocytes. METHODS: We serially cultivated nine primary KS keratinocyte strains until senescence and determined their lifespan and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) at each serial passage. The expression of molecular markers of stemness and cellular senescence were investigated by immunoblotting using cell extracts of primary keratinocyte cultures from patients with KS and healthy donors. In another set of experiments, kindlin-1 downregulation in normal keratinocytes was obtained by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. RESULTS: We found that KS keratinocytes exhibited a precocious senescence and strongly reduced clonogenic potential. Moreover, KS cultures showed a strikingly increased percentage of aborted colonies (paraclones) already at early passages indicating an early depletion of stem cells. Immunoblotting analysis of KS keratinocyte extracts showed reduced levels of the stemness markers p63 and Bmi-1, upregulation of p16 and scant amounts of hypophosphorylated Rb protein, which indicated cell cycle-arrested status. Treatment of normal human primary keratinocytes with siRNA targeting kindlin-1 proved that its deficiency was directly responsible for p63, Bmi-1 and pRb downregulation and p16 induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data directly implicate kindlin-1 in preventing premature senescence of keratinocytes.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering and photosensitivity. KS is caused by loss of function mutations in FERMT1, which encodes Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to integrin β subunits and is required for efficient integrin activation. Using keratinocytes derived from a patient with KS, into which wild-type Kindlin-1 (Kin1WT) has been expressed, we show that Kindlin-1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2. CDK1 and CDK2 are key regulators of cell cycle progression, however, cell cycle analysis showed only small differences between the KS and KS-Kin1WT keratinocytes. In contrast, G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was enhanced in KS keratinocytes but not KS-Kin1WT cells, following inhibition of CDK activity. Furthermore, KS keratinocytes were more sensitive to DNA damage in response to H2 O2 and this was exacerbated by treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. Thus, in Kindlin-1 deficient keratinocytes, CDK activity can further regulate oxidative damage induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. This provides further insight into the key pathways that control sensitivity to oxidative stress in KS patients.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder comprises mechanical skin fragility and photosensitivity, which manifest early in life. The progression of the disorder is irreversible and results in tissue damage in form of cutaneous and mucosal atrophy and scarring and epithelial cancers. Here, we unravel molecular mechanisms of increased UV-B sensitivity of keratinocytes derived from KS patients. We show that the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-α, are upregulated in KS skin and in UV-B irradiated KS keratinocytes. These cytokines are dependent on p38 activation, which is increased in the absence of kindlin-1 and induced by higher ROS levels. Other dysregulated cytokines and growth factors were identified in this study and might be involved in paracrine interactions contributing to KS pathology. We show a direct relationship between kindlin-1 abundance and UV-B induced apoptosis in keratinocytes, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression has no compensatory effect. Importantly, low levels of kindlin-1 are sufficient to relieve or rescue this feature. Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of UV-B induced apoptosis is a valid therapeutic goal to influence long term complications of KS. Here, we demonstrate that antioxidants and the plant flavonoid luteolin represent feasible topical therapeutic approaches decreasing UV-B induced apoptosis in two-dimensional and organotypic KS cultures. We provide evidence for potential new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the progressive course of KS, for which no cure is available to date. Furthermore, we established organotypic KS models, a valuable in vitro tool for research with a morphology similar to the skin of patients in situ.",

We report a novel kindlin-1-deficient keratinocyte cell line derived from a Kindler syndrome patient. Despite the expression of kindlin-2, the patient's cells display several hallmarks related to reduced function of β1 integrins, including abnormal cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and cell migration. Defective cell adhesion was aggravated by kindlin-2 depletion, indicating that kindlin-2 can compensate to a certain extent for the loss of kindlin-1. Intriguingly, β1 at the cell-surface was aberrantly glycosylated in the patient's cells, and its expression was considerably reduced, both in cells in vitro and in the patient's epidermis. Reconstitution with wild-type kindlin-1 but not with a β1-binding defective mutant restored the aberrant β1 expression and glycosylation, and normalized cell morphology, adhesion, spreading, and migration. Furthermore, the expression of wild-type kindlin-1, but not of the integrin-binding-defective mutant, increased the stability of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and enhanced the redistribution of internalized integrins to the cell surface. Thus, these data uncover a role for kindlin-1 in the regulation of integrin trafficking and adhesion turnover.",

Although Kindler syndrome is classified as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, it has distinct clinicopathological and molecular abnormalities. The molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in a newly recognized actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, now known as fermitin family homologue 1, encoded by the gene FERMT1. This protein mediates anchorage between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions, and thus the structural pathology differs from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa in which there is a disruption of the keratin intermediate filament-hemidesmosome network and the extracellular matrix. In the skin, fermitin family homologue 1 is mainly expressed in basal keratinocytes and binds to the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 and beta3 integrins as well as to fermitin family homologue 2 and filamin-binding LIM protein 1. It also plays a crucial role in keratinocyte migration, proliferation and adhesion. In this report, we review the clinical, cellular and molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome and discuss the role of fermitin family homologue 1 in keratinocyte biology.",

Kindlin-1 and -2 are expressed in the skin, but whether and how they cooperate in adult epithelial cells have remained elusive. We uncovered the overlapping roles of kindlin-1 and -2 in maintaining epithelial integrity and show that the phenotype of kindlin-1-deficient cells can be modulated by regulating kindlin-2 gene expression and vice versa. The experimental evidence is provided by use of human keratinocyte cell lines that express both kindlins, just kindlin-1 or kindlin-2, or none of them. Double deficiency of kindlin-1 and -2 had significant negative effects on focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, survival, directional migration, and activation of β(1) integrin, whereas deficiency of one kindlin only showed variable perturbation of these functions. Cell motility and formation of cell-cell contacts were particularly affected by lack of kindlin-2. These results predict that kindlin-1 and -2 can functionally compensate for each other, at least in part. The high physiologic and pathologic significance of the compensation was emphasized by the discovery of environmental regulation of kindlin-2 expression. UV-B irradiation induced loss of kindlin-2 in keratinocytes. This first example of environmental regulation of kindlin expression has implications for phenotype modulation in Kindler syndrome, a skin disorder caused by kindlin-1 deficiency.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome, a distinct type of epidermolysis bullosa, is a rare disorder caused by mutations in FERMT1, encoding kindlin-1. Most FERMT1 mutations lead to premature termination codons and absence of kindlin-1. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular consequences of a naturally occurring FERMT1 mutation, c.299_301del resulting in a single amino acid deletion, p.R100del. The mutation led to a 50% reduction of FERMT1 mRNA and 90% reduction of kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes derived from the patient, as compared with control cells. The misfolded p.R100del kindlin-1 mutant was lysosomally degraded and launched a homeostatic unfolded protein response. Sodium-phenylbutyrate significantly increased kindlin-1 mRNA and protein levels and the area of mutant cells, acting as a chemical chaperone and probably also as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In a recombinant system, low levels of wild-type or p.R100del mutant kindlin-1 were sufficient to improve the cellular phenotype in respect of spreading and proliferation as compared with kindlin-1 negative keratinocytes. The study of this hypomorphic mutation provides evidence that low amounts of kindlin-1 are sufficient to improve the epidermal architecture and Kindler syndrome cellular phenotype and proposes a personalized chaperone therapy for the patient.",

Genetic reversion may occur through different mechanisms, and in a single individual, the mutation can be repaired in various ways. Here we describe a disseminated pattern of revertant mosaicism observed in 6 patients with Kindler syndrome (KS), a genodermatosis caused by loss of kindlin-1 (encoded by FERMT1) and clinically characterized by patchy skin pigmentation and atrophy. All patients presented duplication mutations (c.456dupA and c.676dupC) in FERMT1, and slipped mispairing in direct nucleotide repeats was identified as the reversion mechanism in all investigated revertant skin spots. The sequence around the mutations demonstrated high propensity to mutations, favoring both microinsertions and microdeletions. Additionally, in some revertant patches, mitotic recombination generated areas with homozygous normal keratinocytes. Restoration of kindlin-1 expression led to clinically and structurally normal skin. Since loss of kindlin-1 severely impairs keratinocyte proliferation, we predict that revertant cells have a selective advantage that allows their clonal expansion and, consequently, the improvement of the skin condition.",

Major clinical criteria include acral blistering in infancy and childhood, progressive poikiloderma, skin atrophy, abnormal photosensitivity, and gingival fragility. METHODS: FERMT1 gene was sequenced in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Kindler syndrome. RESULTS: We report a novel pathogenic variant detected in four unrelated families of Paraguayan origin, where one nucleotide deletion in FERMT1 gene (c.450delG) is predicted to cause a frameshift mutation leading to loss of function. Haplotype analysis revealed the propagation of an ancestral allele through this population. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this recurrent pathogenic variant enables optimization of molecular detection strategies in our patients, reducing the cost of diagnosis.",

The FERMT1 mutational spectrum comprises gross genomic deletions, splice site, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which are scattered over the coding region spanning exon 2-15. We now report three KS families with mutations affecting the promoter region of FERMT1. Two of these mutations are large deletions (∼38.0 and 1.9 kb in size) and one is a single nucleotide variant (c.-20A>G) within the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Each mutation resulted in loss of gene expression in patient skin or cultured keratinocytes. Reporter assays showed the functional relevance of the genomic regions deleted in our patients for FERMT1 gene transcription and proved the causal role of the c.-20A>G variant in reducing transcriptional activity.

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to β-integrin subunits and is required for integrin activation. Loss of function mutations in the FERMT1 gene which encodes Kindlin-1 leads to the development of Kindler Syndrome (KS) an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and predisposition to aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we show that loss of Kindlin-1 sensitizes both SCC cells and keratinocytes to oxidative stress: Kindlin-1 deficient cells have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, decreased viability and increased DNA damage after treatment with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or irradiation with UVA. We show that Kindlin-1 is required to fully activate ERK signalling after oxidative damage, and that activation of ERK protects cells from DNA damage following oxidative stress: inhibition of ERK activation sensitizes Kindlin-1 expressing cells, but not Kindlin-1 deficient cells to oxidative stress. Finally we demonstrate that the Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK and protection from DNA damage following oxidative stress depends on the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind integrins. Thus loss of Kindlin-1 leads to an imbalance in the cellular oxidative state, which renders Kindlin-1 deficient cells more prone to the effects of ROS generated in response to oxidative stress. We propose that Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK signalling is a key molecular mechanism that renders KS keratinocytes more sensitive to oxidative damage and contributes to the increased photosensitivity in KS patients.",

Herein we review the clinical and genetic data of 62 patients, and delineate the natural history of the disorder, for example, age at onset of symptoms, or risk of malignancy. Although most mutations are predicted to lead to premature termination of translation, and to loss of kindlin-1 function, significant clinical variability is observed among patients. There is an association of FERMT1 missense and in-frame deletion mutations with milder disease phenotypes, and later onset of complications. Nevertheless, the clinical variability is not fully explained by genotype-phenotype correlations. Environmental factors and yet unidentified modifiers may play a role. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of KS should enable the development of prevention strategies for disease complications.",

Ultrastructural examination reveals marked basement membrane reduplication and variable levels of cleavage at the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular pathology underlying Kindler syndrome has recently been shown to involve loss-of-function mutations in a novel gene, KIND1, encoding kindlin-1. Immunofluorescence, gene expression and cell biology studies have shown that kindlin-1 is expressed mainly in basal keratinocytes and plays a role in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton via focal contacts to the extracellular matrix. Thus, Kindler syndrome is the first genodermatosis caused by a defect in actin-extracellular matrix linkage rather than the classic keratin-extracellular matrix linkage underlying the pathology of other inherited skin fragility disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa. This article reviews the clinical features as well as the molecular and cellular pathology of Kindler syndrome and highlights the importance of the new protein, kindlin-1, in cell-matrix adhesion and its intriguing link to photosensitivity.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kindler syndrome (KS) is a rare, inherited skin disease characterized by blister formation and generalized poikiloderma. Mutations in KIND1, which encodes kindlin-1, are responsible for KS. c.1089del/1089+1del is a recurrent splice-site deletion mutation in KS patients. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of c.1089del/1089+1del at the mRNA and protein level. METHODS: Two KS patients with c.1089del/1089+1del were included in this study. Immunofluorescence analysis of KS skin samples using antibodies against the dermo-epidermal junction proteins was performed. Exon-trapping experiments were performed to isolate the mRNA sequences transcribed from genomic DNA harbouring c.1089del/1089+1del. β1 integrin activation in HeLa cells transfected with truncated KIND1 cDNA was analyzed. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence study showed positive expression of kindlin-1 in KS skin with c.1089del/1089+1del mutation. We identified the exon-8-skipped in-frame transcript as the main product among multiple splicing variants derived from that mutation. HeLa cells transfected with KIND1 cDNA without exon 8 showed impaired β1 integrin activation. Exon-8-coding amino acids are located in the FERM F2 domain, which is conserved among species, and the unstructured region between F2 and the pleckstrin homology domain. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exon-8-skipped truncated kindlin-1 is functionally defective and does not compensate for the defects of KS, even though kindlin-1 expression in skin is positive.",

How and why abnormalities in kindlin-1 disrupt keratinocyte cell biology in KS, however, is not yet known. In this study, we identified two previously unreported binding proteins of kindlin-1: kindlin-2 and migfilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies show that these three proteins bind to each other and colocalize at focal adhesion in HaCaT cells and normal human keratinocytes. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in KIND1 result in marked variability in kindlin-1 immunolabeling in KS skin, which is mirrored by similar changes in kindlin-2 and migfilin immunoreactivity. Kindlin-1, however, may function independently of kindlin-2 and migfilin, as loss of kindlin-1 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes by RNA interference and in KS keratinocytes does not affect KIND2 or FBLIM1 (migfilin) gene expression or kindlin-2 and migfilin protein localization. In addition to identifying protein-binding partners for kindlin-1, this study also highlights that KIND1 gene expression and kindlin-1 protein labeling are not always reduced in KS, findings that are relevant to the accurate laboratory diagnosis of this genodermatosis by skin immunohistochemistry.",

The Kindlin-1-related diseases are confined in limited tissue types. However, Kindlin-1 tissue distribution and the dogma that governs Kindlin-1 expression in normal human body are elusive. This study examined Kindlin-1 expression in normal human adult organs, human and mouse embryonic organs by immunohistochemical analyses. We identified a general principle that the level of Kindlin-1 expression in tissues is tightly correlated with the corresponding germ layers from which these tissues originate. We compared the expression of Kindlin-1 with Kindlin-2 and found that Kindlin-1 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues derived from ectoderm and endoderm, whereas Kindlin-2 is mainly expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues. Likewise, Kindlin-1 was also found highly expressed in endoderm/ectoderm-derived tissues in human and mouse embryos. Our findings indicate that Kindlin-1 may play an importance role in the development of endoderm/ectoderm related tissues. ",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is a progressive skin disorder caused by FERMT1 mutations. Early in life, KS manifests as a mechanobullous disease reflecting diminished cell adhesion, but the mechanisms of its later phenotypic features, progressive poikiloderma, and mucocutaneous fibrosis, remain elusive. The FERMT1 gene product and KS protein, kindlin-1, is an epithelial-specific phosphoprotein involved in integrin beta-1 activation, without an obvious link to dermal connective tissue. Here we show how lack of intracellular kindlin-1 in epidermal keratinocytes leads to profound changes in another skin compartment, the dermis. Kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes respond to cell stress by upregulating the expression of cytokines such as IL-20, IL-24, TGF-β2, IL1F5, PDGFB, and CTGF. These launch-via paracrine communication-an inflammatory response in the dermis, accompanied by the presence of TGF-β, IL-6, and CTGF, activation of fibroblasts and their differentiation to myofibroblasts, which secrete and deposit increased amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. These data are concordant with a model wherein repeated cycles of epidermal cell stress, cytokine secretion, dermal inflammation, and profibrotic processes underlie mucocutaneous fibrosis in KS.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) results from pathogenic loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, which encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton-related protein. How and why abnormalities in kindlin-1 disrupt keratinocyte cell biology in KS, however, is not yet known. In this study, we identified two previously unreported binding proteins of kindlin-1: kindlin-2 and migfilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies show that these three proteins bind to each other and colocalize at focal adhesion in HaCaT cells and normal human keratinocytes. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in KIND1 result in marked variability in kindlin-1 immunolabeling in KS skin, which is mirrored by similar changes in kindlin-2 and migfilin immunoreactivity. Kindlin-1, however, may function independently of kindlin-2 and migfilin, as loss of kindlin-1 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes by RNA interference and in KS keratinocytes does not affect KIND2 or FBLIM1 (migfilin) gene expression or kindlin-2 and migfilin protein localization. In addition to identifying protein-binding partners for kindlin-1, this study also highlights that KIND1 gene expression and kindlin-1 protein labeling are not always reduced in KS, findings that are relevant to the accurate laboratory diagnosis of this genodermatosis by skin immunohistochemistry.",

Herein we review the clinical and genetic data of 62 patients, and delineate the natural history of the disorder, for example, age at onset of symptoms, or risk of malignancy. Although most mutations are predicted to lead to premature termination of translation, and to loss of kindlin-1 function, significant clinical variability is observed among patients. There is an association of FERMT1 missense and in-frame deletion mutations with milder disease phenotypes, and later onset of complications. Nevertheless, the clinical variability is not fully explained by genotype-phenotype correlations. Environmental factors and yet unidentified modifiers may play a role. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of KS should enable the development of prevention strategies for disease complications.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering and photosensitivity. KS is caused by loss of function mutations in FERMT1, which encodes Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to integrin β subunits and is required for efficient integrin activation. Using keratinocytes derived from a patient with KS, into which wild-type Kindlin-1 (Kin1WT) has been expressed, we show that Kindlin-1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2. CDK1 and CDK2 are key regulators of cell cycle progression, however, cell cycle analysis showed only small differences between the KS and KS-Kin1WT keratinocytes. In contrast, G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was enhanced in KS keratinocytes but not KS-Kin1WT cells, following inhibition of CDK activity. Furthermore, KS keratinocytes were more sensitive to DNA damage in response to H2 O2 and this was exacerbated by treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. Thus, in Kindlin-1 deficient keratinocytes, CDK activity can further regulate oxidative damage induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. This provides further insight into the key pathways that control sensitivity to oxidative stress in KS patients.",

            "abstract": "Kindlins are a novel family of intracellular adaptor proteins in integrin-containing focal adhesions. Kindlin-1 and -2 are expressed in the skin, but whether and how they cooperate in adult epithelial cells have remained elusive. We uncovered the overlapping roles of kindlin-1 and -2 in maintaining epithelial integrity and show that the phenotype of kindlin-1-deficient cells can be modulated by regulating kindlin-2 gene expression and vice versa. The experimental evidence is provided by use of human keratinocyte cell lines that express both kindlins, just kindlin-1 or kindlin-2, or none of them. Double deficiency of kindlin-1 and -2 had significant negative effects on focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, survival, directional migration, and activation of β(1) integrin, whereas deficiency of one kindlin only showed variable perturbation of these functions. Cell motility and formation of cell-cell contacts were particularly affected by lack of kindlin-2. These results predict that kindlin-1 and -2 can functionally compensate for each other, at least in part. The high physiologic and pathologic significance of the compensation was emphasized by the discovery of environmental regulation of kindlin-2 expression. UV-B irradiation induced loss of kindlin-2 in keratinocytes. This first example of environmental regulation of kindlin expression has implications for phenotype modulation in Kindler syndrome, a skin disorder caused by kindlin-1 deficiency.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kindler syndrome (KS) is a rare, inherited skin disease characterized by blister formation and generalized poikiloderma. Mutations in KIND1, which encodes kindlin-1, are responsible for KS. c.1089del/1089+1del is a recurrent splice-site deletion mutation in KS patients. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of c.1089del/1089+1del at the mRNA and protein level. METHODS: Two KS patients with c.1089del/1089+1del were included in this study. Immunofluorescence analysis of KS skin samples using antibodies against the dermo-epidermal junction proteins was performed. Exon-trapping experiments were performed to isolate the mRNA sequences transcribed from genomic DNA harbouring c.1089del/1089+1del. β1 integrin activation in HeLa cells transfected with truncated KIND1 cDNA was analyzed. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence study showed positive expression of kindlin-1 in KS skin with c.1089del/1089+1del mutation. We identified the exon-8-skipped in-frame transcript as the main product among multiple splicing variants derived from that mutation. HeLa cells transfected with KIND1 cDNA without exon 8 showed impaired β1 integrin activation. Exon-8-coding amino acids are located in the FERM F2 domain, which is conserved among species, and the unstructured region between F2 and the pleckstrin homology domain. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exon-8-skipped truncated kindlin-1 is functionally defective and does not compensate for the defects of KS, even though kindlin-1 expression in skin is positive.",

We report a novel kindlin-1-deficient keratinocyte cell line derived from a Kindler syndrome patient. Despite the expression of kindlin-2, the patient's cells display several hallmarks related to reduced function of β1 integrins, including abnormal cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and cell migration. Defective cell adhesion was aggravated by kindlin-2 depletion, indicating that kindlin-2 can compensate to a certain extent for the loss of kindlin-1. Intriguingly, β1 at the cell-surface was aberrantly glycosylated in the patient's cells, and its expression was considerably reduced, both in cells in vitro and in the patient's epidermis. Reconstitution with wild-type kindlin-1 but not with a β1-binding defective mutant restored the aberrant β1 expression and glycosylation, and normalized cell morphology, adhesion, spreading, and migration. Furthermore, the expression of wild-type kindlin-1, but not of the integrin-binding-defective mutant, increased the stability of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and enhanced the redistribution of internalized integrins to the cell surface. Thus, these data uncover a role for kindlin-1 in the regulation of integrin trafficking and adhesion turnover.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Kindler syndrome (KS) have loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene that encodes the focal adhesion component kindlin-1. The major clinical manifestation of KS is epidermal atrophy (premature skin ageing). This phenotypic feature is thought to be related to the decreased proliferation rate of KS keratinocytes; nevertheless, molecular mediators of such abnormal behaviour have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how kindlin-1 deficiency affects the proliferative potential of primary human keratinocytes. METHODS: We serially cultivated nine primary KS keratinocyte strains until senescence and determined their lifespan and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) at each serial passage. The expression of molecular markers of stemness and cellular senescence were investigated by immunoblotting using cell extracts of primary keratinocyte cultures from patients with KS and healthy donors. In another set of experiments, kindlin-1 downregulation in normal keratinocytes was obtained by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. RESULTS: We found that KS keratinocytes exhibited a precocious senescence and strongly reduced clonogenic potential. Moreover, KS cultures showed a strikingly increased percentage of aborted colonies (paraclones) already at early passages indicating an early depletion of stem cells. Immunoblotting analysis of KS keratinocyte extracts showed reduced levels of the stemness markers p63 and Bmi-1, upregulation of p16 and scant amounts of hypophosphorylated Rb protein, which indicated cell cycle-arrested status. Treatment of normal human primary keratinocytes with siRNA targeting kindlin-1 proved that its deficiency was directly responsible for p63, Bmi-1 and pRb downregulation and p16 induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data directly implicate kindlin-1 in preventing premature senescence of keratinocytes.",

Although Kindler syndrome is classified as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, it has distinct clinicopathological and molecular abnormalities. The molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in a newly recognized actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, now known as fermitin family homologue 1, encoded by the gene FERMT1. This protein mediates anchorage between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions, and thus the structural pathology differs from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa in which there is a disruption of the keratin intermediate filament-hemidesmosome network and the extracellular matrix. In the skin, fermitin family homologue 1 is mainly expressed in basal keratinocytes and binds to the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 and beta3 integrins as well as to fermitin family homologue 2 and filamin-binding LIM protein 1. It also plays a crucial role in keratinocyte migration, proliferation and adhesion. In this report, we review the clinical, cellular and molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome and discuss the role of fermitin family homologue 1 in keratinocyte biology.",

The FERMT1 mutational spectrum comprises gross genomic deletions, splice site, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which are scattered over the coding region spanning exon 2-15. We now report three KS families with mutations affecting the promoter region of FERMT1. Two of these mutations are large deletions (∼38.0 and 1.9 kb in size) and one is a single nucleotide variant (c.-20A>G) within the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Each mutation resulted in loss of gene expression in patient skin or cultured keratinocytes. Reporter assays showed the functional relevance of the genomic regions deleted in our patients for FERMT1 gene transcription and proved the causal role of the c.-20A>G variant in reducing transcriptional activity.

Most FERMT1 mutations lead to premature termination codons and absence of kindlin-1. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular consequences of a naturally occurring FERMT1 mutation, c.299_301del resulting in a single amino acid deletion, p.R100del. The mutation led to a 50% reduction of FERMT1 mRNA and 90% reduction of kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes derived from the patient, as compared with control cells. The misfolded p.R100del kindlin-1 mutant was lysosomally degraded and launched a homeostatic unfolded protein response. Sodium-phenylbutyrate significantly increased kindlin-1 mRNA and protein levels and the area of mutant cells, acting as a chemical chaperone and probably also as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In a recombinant system, low levels of wild-type or p.R100del mutant kindlin-1 were sufficient to improve the cellular phenotype in respect of spreading and proliferation as compared with kindlin-1 negative keratinocytes. The study of this hypomorphic mutation provides evidence that low amounts of kindlin-1 are sufficient to improve the epidermal architecture and Kindler syndrome cellular phenotype and proposes a personalized chaperone therapy for the patient.",

The Kindlin-1-related diseases are confined in limited tissue types. However, Kindlin-1 tissue distribution and the dogma that governs Kindlin-1 expression in normal human body are elusive. This study examined Kindlin-1 expression in normal human adult organs, human and mouse embryonic organs by immunohistochemical analyses. We identified a general principle that the level of Kindlin-1 expression in tissues is tightly correlated with the corresponding germ layers from which these tissues originate. We compared the expression of Kindlin-1 with Kindlin-2 and found that Kindlin-1 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues derived from ectoderm and endoderm, whereas Kindlin-2 is mainly expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues. Likewise, Kindlin-1 was also found highly expressed in endoderm/ectoderm-derived tissues in human and mouse embryos. Our findings indicate that Kindlin-1 may play an importance role in the development of endoderm/ectoderm related tissues. ",

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is an adaptor protein that is expressed by most epithelial cells and has been implicated in integrin bidirectional signaling. Mutations in the gene encoding kindlin-1 are associated with Kindler syndrome, a recessively inherited disorder that is characterized by fragile skin. Functionally, a loss of kindlin-1 impairs the adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the extracellular matrix both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we show that the phenotype of mutant keratinocytes deficient in kindlin-1 is characterized by the modification of the cortical actin network and increased plasticity of the plasma membrane. At the molecular level, expression of several proteins associated with an epithelial phenotype, such as α6β4 integrin, collagen XVII, E-cadherin, and desmoglein-3, is strongly reduced, whereas, surprisingly, laminin 332 is synthesized in larger amounts than in control keratinocytes. In contrast, mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin are increased in keratinocytes lacking kindlin-1. The switch in cell plasticity and protein expression was confirmed by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of kindlin-1 in HaCaT epithelial cells. Furthermore, there was up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines in kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes. These results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that take place in Kindler syndrome. Moreover, the constellation of molecular defects associated with the loss of kindlin-1 may explain the higher incidence of skin cancer observed in patients affected with this disorder.",

The progression of the disorder is irreversible and results in tissue damage in form of cutaneous and mucosal atrophy and scarring and epithelial cancers. Here, we unravel molecular mechanisms of increased UV-B sensitivity of keratinocytes derived from KS patients. We show that the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-α, are upregulated in KS skin and in UV-B irradiated KS keratinocytes. These cytokines are dependent on p38 activation, which is increased in the absence of kindlin-1 and induced by higher ROS levels. Other dysregulated cytokines and growth factors were identified in this study and might be involved in paracrine interactions contributing to KS pathology. We show a direct relationship between kindlin-1 abundance and UV-B induced apoptosis in keratinocytes, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression has no compensatory effect. Importantly, low levels of kindlin-1 are sufficient to relieve or rescue this feature. Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of UV-B induced apoptosis is a valid therapeutic goal to influence long term complications of KS. Here, we demonstrate that antioxidants and the plant flavonoid luteolin represent feasible topical therapeutic approaches decreasing UV-B induced apoptosis in two-dimensional and organotypic KS cultures. We provide evidence for potential new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the progressive course of KS, for which no cure is available to date. Furthermore, we established organotypic KS models, a valuable in vitro tool for research with a morphology similar to the skin of patients in situ.",

            "abstract": "Spontaneous gene repair, also called revertant mosaicism, has been documented in several genetic disorders involving organs that undergo self-regeneration, including the skin. Genetic reversion may occur through different mechanisms, and in a single individual, the mutation can be repaired in various ways. Here we describe a disseminated pattern of revertant mosaicism observed in 6 patients with Kindler syndrome (KS), a genodermatosis caused by loss of kindlin-1 (encoded by FERMT1) and clinically characterized by patchy skin pigmentation and atrophy. All patients presented duplication mutations (c.456dupA and c.676dupC) in FERMT1, and slipped mispairing in direct nucleotide repeats was identified as the reversion mechanism in all investigated revertant skin spots. The sequence around the mutations demonstrated high propensity to mutations, favoring both microinsertions and microdeletions. Additionally, in some revertant patches, mitotic recombination generated areas with homozygous normal keratinocytes. Restoration of kindlin-1 expression led to clinically and structurally normal skin. Since loss of kindlin-1 severely impairs keratinocyte proliferation, we predict that revertant cells have a selective advantage that allows their clonal expansion and, consequently, the improvement of the skin condition.",

Loss of function mutations in the FERMT1 gene which encodes Kindlin-1 leads to the development of Kindler Syndrome (KS) an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and predisposition to aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we show that loss of Kindlin-1 sensitizes both SCC cells and keratinocytes to oxidative stress: Kindlin-1 deficient cells have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, decreased viability and increased DNA damage after treatment with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or irradiation with UVA. We show that Kindlin-1 is required to fully activate ERK signalling after oxidative damage, and that activation of ERK protects cells from DNA damage following oxidative stress: inhibition of ERK activation sensitizes Kindlin-1 expressing cells, but not Kindlin-1 deficient cells to oxidative stress. Finally we demonstrate that the Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK and protection from DNA damage following oxidative stress depends on the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind integrins. Thus loss of Kindlin-1 leads to an imbalance in the cellular oxidative state, which renders Kindlin-1 deficient cells more prone to the effects of ROS generated in response to oxidative stress. We propose that Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK signalling is a key molecular mechanism that renders KS keratinocytes more sensitive to oxidative damage and contributes to the increased photosensitivity in KS patients.",

Early in life, KS manifests as a mechanobullous disease reflecting diminished cell adhesion, but the mechanisms of its later phenotypic features, progressive poikiloderma, and mucocutaneous fibrosis, remain elusive. The FERMT1 gene product and KS protein, kindlin-1, is an epithelial-specific phosphoprotein involved in integrin beta-1 activation, without an obvious link to dermal connective tissue. Here we show how lack of intracellular kindlin-1 in epidermal keratinocytes leads to profound changes in another skin compartment, the dermis. Kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes respond to cell stress by upregulating the expression of cytokines such as IL-20, IL-24, TGF-β2, IL1F5, PDGFB, and CTGF. These launch-via paracrine communication-an inflammatory response in the dermis, accompanied by the presence of TGF-β, IL-6, and CTGF, activation of fibroblasts and their differentiation to myofibroblasts, which secrete and deposit increased amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. These data are concordant with a model wherein repeated cycles of epidermal cell stress, cytokine secretion, dermal inflammation, and profibrotic processes underlie mucocutaneous fibrosis in KS.",

Ultrastructural examination reveals marked basement membrane reduplication and variable levels of cleavage at the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular pathology underlying Kindler syndrome has recently been shown to involve loss-of-function mutations in a novel gene, KIND1, encoding kindlin-1. Immunofluorescence, gene expression and cell biology studies have shown that kindlin-1 is expressed mainly in basal keratinocytes and plays a role in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton via focal contacts to the extracellular matrix. Thus, Kindler syndrome is the first genodermatosis caused by a defect in actin-extracellular matrix linkage rather than the classic keratin-extracellular matrix linkage underlying the pathology of other inherited skin fragility disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa. This article reviews the clinical features as well as the molecular and cellular pathology of Kindler syndrome and highlights the importance of the new protein, kindlin-1, in cell-matrix adhesion and its intriguing link to photosensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT1. This gene encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in activation of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and migration. Electric fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin-1 but not a W612A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin-1 was also required for the maintenance of lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin-1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology.",

Fewer than 100 cases have been described in the literature. First reported in 1954, the molecular basis of Kindler syndrome was elucidated in 2003 with the discovery of FERMT1 (KIND1) loss-of-function mutations in affected individuals. The FERMT1 gene encodes kindlin-1 (also known as fermitin family homologue 1), a 77 kDa protein that localizes at focal adhesions, where it plays an important role in integrin signalling. In the current study, we describe five novel and three recurrent loss-of-function FERMT1 mutations in eight individuals with Kindler syndrome, and provide an overview of genotype-phenotype correlation in this disorder.",

Major clinical criteria include acral blistering in infancy and childhood, progressive poikiloderma, skin atrophy, abnormal photosensitivity, and gingival fragility. METHODS: FERMT1 gene was sequenced in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Kindler syndrome. RESULTS: We report a novel pathogenic variant detected in four unrelated families of Paraguayan origin, where one nucleotide deletion in FERMT1 gene (c.450delG) is predicted to cause a frameshift mutation leading to loss of function. Haplotype analysis revealed the propagation of an ancestral allele through this population. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this recurrent pathogenic variant enables optimization of molecular detection strategies in our patients, reducing the cost of diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering and photosensitivity. KS is caused by loss of function mutations in FERMT1, which encodes Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to integrin β subunits and is required for efficient integrin activation. Using keratinocytes derived from a patient with KS, into which wild-type Kindlin-1 (Kin1WT) has been expressed, we show that Kindlin-1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2. CDK1 and CDK2 are key regulators of cell cycle progression, however, cell cycle analysis showed only small differences between the KS and KS-Kin1WT keratinocytes. In contrast, G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was enhanced in KS keratinocytes but not KS-Kin1WT cells, following inhibition of CDK activity. Furthermore, KS keratinocytes were more sensitive to DNA damage in response to H2 O2 and this was exacerbated by treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. Thus, in Kindlin-1 deficient keratinocytes, CDK activity can further regulate oxidative damage induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. This provides further insight into the key pathways that control sensitivity to oxidative stress in KS patients.",

            "abstract": "Kindlins are a novel family of intracellular adaptor proteins in integrin-containing focal adhesions. Kindlin-1 and -2 are expressed in the skin, but whether and how they cooperate in adult epithelial cells have remained elusive. We uncovered the overlapping roles of kindlin-1 and -2 in maintaining epithelial integrity and show that the phenotype of kindlin-1-deficient cells can be modulated by regulating kindlin-2 gene expression and vice versa. The experimental evidence is provided by use of human keratinocyte cell lines that express both kindlins, just kindlin-1 or kindlin-2, or none of them. Double deficiency of kindlin-1 and -2 had significant negative effects on focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, survival, directional migration, and activation of β(1) integrin, whereas deficiency of one kindlin only showed variable perturbation of these functions. Cell motility and formation of cell-cell contacts were particularly affected by lack of kindlin-2. These results predict that kindlin-1 and -2 can functionally compensate for each other, at least in part. The high physiologic and pathologic significance of the compensation was emphasized by the discovery of environmental regulation of kindlin-2 expression. UV-B irradiation induced loss of kindlin-2 in keratinocytes.

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder comprises mechanical skin fragility and photosensitivity, which manifest early in life. The progression of the disorder is irreversible and results in tissue damage in form of cutaneous and mucosal atrophy and scarring and epithelial cancers. Here, we unravel molecular mechanisms of increased UV-B sensitivity of keratinocytes derived from KS patients. We show that the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-α, are upregulated in KS skin and in UV-B irradiated KS keratinocytes. These cytokines are dependent on p38 activation, which is increased in the absence of kindlin-1 and induced by higher ROS levels. Other dysregulated cytokines and growth factors were identified in this study and might be involved in paracrine interactions contributing to KS pathology. We show a direct relationship between kindlin-1 abundance and UV-B induced apoptosis in keratinocytes, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression has no compensatory effect. Importantly, low levels of kindlin-1 are sufficient to relieve or rescue this feature. Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of UV-B induced apoptosis is a valid therapeutic goal to influence long term complications of KS. Here, we demonstrate that antioxidants and the plant flavonoid luteolin represent feasible topical therapeutic approaches decreasing UV-B induced apoptosis in two-dimensional and organotypic KS cultures. We provide evidence for potential new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the progressive course of KS, for which no cure is available to date. Furthermore, we established organotypic KS models, a valuable in vitro tool for research with a morphology similar to the skin of patients in situ.",

Most FERMT1 mutations lead to premature termination codons and absence of kindlin-1. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular consequences of a naturally occurring FERMT1 mutation, c.299_301del resulting in a single amino acid deletion, p.R100del. The mutation led to a 50% reduction of FERMT1 mRNA and 90% reduction of kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes derived from the patient, as compared with control cells. The misfolded p.R100del kindlin-1 mutant was lysosomally degraded and launched a homeostatic unfolded protein response. Sodium-phenylbutyrate significantly increased kindlin-1 mRNA and protein levels and the area of mutant cells, acting as a chemical chaperone and probably also as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In a recombinant system, low levels of wild-type or p.R100del mutant kindlin-1 were sufficient to improve the cellular phenotype in respect of spreading and proliferation as compared with kindlin-1 negative keratinocytes. The study of this hypomorphic mutation provides evidence that low amounts of kindlin-1 are sufficient to improve the epidermal architecture and Kindler syndrome cellular phenotype and proposes a personalized chaperone therapy for the patient.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Kindler syndrome (KS) have loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene that encodes the focal adhesion component kindlin-1. The major clinical manifestation of KS is epidermal atrophy (premature skin ageing). This phenotypic feature is thought to be related to the decreased proliferation rate of KS keratinocytes; nevertheless, molecular mediators of such abnormal behaviour have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how kindlin-1 deficiency affects the proliferative potential of primary human keratinocytes. METHODS: We serially cultivated nine primary KS keratinocyte strains until senescence and determined their lifespan and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) at each serial passage. The expression of molecular markers of stemness and cellular senescence were investigated by immunoblotting using cell extracts of primary keratinocyte cultures from patients with KS and healthy donors. In another set of experiments, kindlin-1 downregulation in normal keratinocytes was obtained by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. RESULTS: We found that KS keratinocytes exhibited a precocious senescence and strongly reduced clonogenic potential. Moreover, KS cultures showed a strikingly increased percentage of aborted colonies (paraclones) already at early passages indicating an early depletion of stem cells. Immunoblotting analysis of KS keratinocyte extracts showed reduced levels of the stemness markers p63 and Bmi-1, upregulation of p16 and scant amounts of hypophosphorylated Rb protein, which indicated cell cycle-arrested status. Treatment of normal human primary keratinocytes with siRNA targeting kindlin-1 proved that its deficiency was directly responsible for p63, Bmi-1 and pRb downregulation and p16 induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data directly implicate kindlin-1 in preventing premature senescence of keratinocytes.",

The Kindlin-1-related diseases are confined in limited tissue types. However, Kindlin-1 tissue distribution and the dogma that governs Kindlin-1 expression in normal human body are elusive. This study examined Kindlin-1 expression in normal human adult organs, human and mouse embryonic organs by immunohistochemical analyses. We identified a general principle that the level of Kindlin-1 expression in tissues is tightly correlated with the corresponding germ layers from which these tissues originate. We compared the expression of Kindlin-1 with Kindlin-2 and found that Kindlin-1 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues derived from ectoderm and endoderm, whereas Kindlin-2 is mainly expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues. Likewise, Kindlin-1 was also found highly expressed in endoderm/ectoderm-derived tissues in human and mouse embryos. Our findings indicate that Kindlin-1 may play an importance role in the development of endoderm/ectoderm related tissues. ",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is a progressive skin disorder caused by FERMT1 mutations. Early in life, KS manifests as a mechanobullous disease reflecting diminished cell adhesion, but the mechanisms of its later phenotypic features, progressive poikiloderma, and mucocutaneous fibrosis, remain elusive. The FERMT1 gene product and KS protein, kindlin-1, is an epithelial-specific phosphoprotein involved in integrin beta-1 activation, without an obvious link to dermal connective tissue. Here we show how lack of intracellular kindlin-1 in epidermal keratinocytes leads to profound changes in another skin compartment, the dermis. Kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes respond to cell stress by upregulating the expression of cytokines such as IL-20, IL-24, TGF-β2, IL1F5, PDGFB, and CTGF. These launch-via paracrine communication-an inflammatory response in the dermis, accompanied by the presence of TGF-β, IL-6, and CTGF, activation of fibroblasts and their differentiation to myofibroblasts, which secrete and deposit increased amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. These data are concordant with a model wherein repeated cycles of epidermal cell stress, cytokine secretion, dermal inflammation, and profibrotic processes underlie mucocutaneous fibrosis in KS.",

Although Kindler syndrome is classified as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, it has distinct clinicopathological and molecular abnormalities. The molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in a newly recognized actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, now known as fermitin family homologue 1, encoded by the gene FERMT1. This protein mediates anchorage between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions, and thus the structural pathology differs from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa in which there is a disruption of the keratin intermediate filament-hemidesmosome network and the extracellular matrix. In the skin, fermitin family homologue 1 is mainly expressed in basal keratinocytes and binds to the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 and beta3 integrins as well as to fermitin family homologue 2 and filamin-binding LIM protein 1. It also plays a crucial role in keratinocyte migration, proliferation and adhesion. In this report, we review the clinical, cellular and molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome and discuss the role of fermitin family homologue 1 in keratinocyte biology.",

            "abstract": "Spontaneous gene repair, also called revertant mosaicism, has been documented in several genetic disorders involving organs that undergo self-regeneration, including the skin. Genetic reversion may occur through different mechanisms, and in a single individual, the mutation can be repaired in various ways. Here we describe a disseminated pattern of revertant mosaicism observed in 6 patients with Kindler syndrome (KS), a genodermatosis caused by loss of kindlin-1 (encoded by FERMT1) and clinically characterized by patchy skin pigmentation and atrophy. All patients presented duplication mutations (c.456dupA and c.676dupC) in FERMT1, and slipped mispairing in direct nucleotide repeats was identified as the reversion mechanism in all investigated revertant skin spots. The sequence around the mutations demonstrated high propensity to mutations, favoring both microinsertions and microdeletions. Additionally, in some revertant patches, mitotic recombination generated areas with homozygous normal keratinocytes. Restoration of kindlin-1 expression led to clinically and structurally normal skin. Since loss of kindlin-1 severely impairs keratinocyte proliferation, we predict that revertant cells have a selective advantage that allows their clonal expansion and, consequently, the improvement of the skin condition.",

Mutations in KIND1, which encodes kindlin-1, are responsible for KS. c.1089del/1089+1del is a recurrent splice-site deletion mutation in KS patients. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of c.1089del/1089+1del at the mRNA and protein level. METHODS: Two KS patients with c.1089del/1089+1del were included in this study. Immunofluorescence analysis of KS skin samples using antibodies against the dermo-epidermal junction proteins was performed. Exon-trapping experiments were performed to isolate the mRNA sequences transcribed from genomic DNA harbouring c.1089del/1089+1del. β1 integrin activation in HeLa cells transfected with truncated KIND1 cDNA was analyzed. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence study showed positive expression of kindlin-1 in KS skin with c.1089del/1089+1del mutation. We identified the exon-8-skipped in-frame transcript as the main product among multiple splicing variants derived from that mutation. HeLa cells transfected with KIND1 cDNA without exon 8 showed impaired β1 integrin activation. Exon-8-coding amino acids are located in the FERM F2 domain, which is conserved among species, and the unstructured region between F2 and the pleckstrin homology domain. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exon-8-skipped truncated kindlin-1 is functionally defective and does not compensate for the defects of KS, even though kindlin-1 expression in skin is positive.",

The FERMT1 gene encodes kindlin-1 (also known as fermitin family homologue 1), a 77 kDa protein that localizes at focal adhesions, where it plays an important role in integrin signalling.

Major clinical criteria include acral blistering in infancy and childhood, progressive poikiloderma, skin atrophy, abnormal photosensitivity, and gingival fragility. METHODS: FERMT1 gene was sequenced in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Kindler syndrome. RESULTS: We report a novel pathogenic variant detected in four unrelated families of Paraguayan origin, where one nucleotide deletion in FERMT1 gene (c.450delG) is predicted to cause a frameshift mutation leading to loss of function. Haplotype analysis revealed the propagation of an ancestral allele through this population. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this recurrent pathogenic variant enables optimization of molecular detection strategies in our patients, reducing the cost of diagnosis.",

The FERMT1 mutational spectrum comprises gross genomic deletions, splice site, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which are scattered over the coding region spanning exon 2-15. We now report three KS families with mutations affecting the promoter region of FERMT1. Two of these mutations are large deletions (∼38.0 and 1.9 kb in size) and one is a single nucleotide variant (c.-20A>G) within the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Each mutation resulted in loss of gene expression in patient skin or cultured keratinocytes. Reporter assays showed the functional relevance of the genomic regions deleted in our patients for FERMT1 gene transcription and proved the causal role of the c.-20A>G variant in reducing transcriptional activity.

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to β-integrin subunits and is required for integrin activation. Loss of function mutations in the FERMT1 gene which encodes Kindlin-1 leads to the development of Kindler Syndrome (KS) an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and predisposition to aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we show that loss of Kindlin-1 sensitizes both SCC cells and keratinocytes to oxidative stress: Kindlin-1 deficient cells have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, decreased viability and increased DNA damage after treatment with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or irradiation with UVA. We show that Kindlin-1 is required to fully activate ERK signalling after oxidative damage, and that activation of ERK protects cells from DNA damage following oxidative stress: inhibition of ERK activation sensitizes Kindlin-1 expressing cells, but not Kindlin-1 deficient cells to oxidative stress. Finally we demonstrate that the Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK and protection from DNA damage following oxidative stress depends on the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind integrins. Thus loss of Kindlin-1 leads to an imbalance in the cellular oxidative state, which renders Kindlin-1 deficient cells more prone to the effects of ROS generated in response to oxidative stress. We propose that Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK signalling is a key molecular mechanism that renders KS keratinocytes more sensitive to oxidative damage and contributes to the increased photosensitivity in KS patients.",

Clinically, since childhood, she had widespread pigmentary changes in her skin as well as photosensitivity and fragility of the skin and mucous membranes. The mucosal involvement led to an erosive stomatitis as well as esophageal, anal and vaginal stenoses, requiring surgical intervention. The diagnosis of Kindler syndrome was confirmed by DNA sequencing with compound heterozygosity for a nonsense/frameshift combination of mutations (p.Arg110X; p.Ala289GlyfsX7) in the FERMT1 gene. ",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) results from pathogenic loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, which encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton-related protein. How and why abnormalities in kindlin-1 disrupt keratinocyte cell biology in KS, however, is not yet known. In this study, we identified two previously unreported binding proteins of kindlin-1: kindlin-2 and migfilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies show that these three proteins bind to each other and colocalize at focal adhesion in HaCaT cells and normal human keratinocytes. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in KIND1 result in marked variability in kindlin-1 immunolabeling in KS skin, which is mirrored by similar changes in kindlin-2 and migfilin immunoreactivity. Kindlin-1, however, may function independently of kindlin-2 and migfilin, as loss of kindlin-1 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes by RNA interference and in KS keratinocytes does not affect KIND2 or FBLIM1 (migfilin) gene expression or kindlin-2 and migfilin protein localization. In addition to identifying protein-binding partners for kindlin-1, this study also highlights that KIND1 gene expression and kindlin-1 protein labeling are not always reduced in KS, findings that are relevant to the accurate laboratory diagnosis of this genodermatosis by skin immunohistochemistry.",

We report a novel kindlin-1-deficient keratinocyte cell line derived from a Kindler syndrome patient. Despite the expression of kindlin-2, the patient's cells display several hallmarks related to reduced function of β1 integrins, including abnormal cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and cell migration. Defective cell adhesion was aggravated by kindlin-2 depletion, indicating that kindlin-2 can compensate to a certain extent for the loss of kindlin-1. Intriguingly, β1 at the cell-surface was aberrantly glycosylated in the patient's cells, and its expression was considerably reduced, both in cells in vitro and in the patient's epidermis. Reconstitution with wild-type kindlin-1 but not with a β1-binding defective mutant restored the aberrant β1 expression and glycosylation, and normalized cell morphology, adhesion, spreading, and migration. Furthermore, the expression of wild-type kindlin-1, but not of the integrin-binding-defective mutant, increased the stability of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and enhanced the redistribution of internalized integrins to the cell surface. Thus, these data uncover a role for kindlin-1 in the regulation of integrin trafficking and adhesion turnover.",

            "abstract": "Mutations in the FERMT1 gene (also known as KIND1), encoding the focal adhesion protein kindlin-1, underlie the Kindler syndrome (KS), an autosomal recessive skin disorder with an intriguing progressive phenotype comprising skin blistering, photosensitivity, progressive poikiloderma with extensive skin atrophy, and propensity to skin cancer. Herein we review the clinical and genetic data of 62 patients, and delineate the natural history of the disorder, for example, age at onset of symptoms, or risk of malignancy. Although most mutations are predicted to lead to premature termination of translation, and to loss of kindlin-1 function, significant clinical variability is observed among patients. There is an association of FERMT1 missense and in-frame deletion mutations with milder disease phenotypes, and later onset of complications. Nevertheless, the clinical variability is not fully explained by genotype-phenotype correlations. Environmental factors and yet unidentified modifiers may play a role. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of KS should enable the development of prevention strategies for disease complications.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT1. This gene encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in activation of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and migration. Electric fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin-1 but not a W612A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin-1 was also required for the maintenance of lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin-1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology.",

Ultrastructural examination reveals marked basement membrane reduplication and variable levels of cleavage at the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular pathology underlying Kindler syndrome has recently been shown to involve loss-of-function mutations in a novel gene, KIND1, encoding kindlin-1. Immunofluorescence, gene expression and cell biology studies have shown that kindlin-1 is expressed mainly in basal keratinocytes and plays a role in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton via focal contacts to the extracellular matrix. Thus, Kindler syndrome is the first genodermatosis caused by a defect in actin-extracellular matrix linkage rather than the classic keratin-extracellular matrix linkage underlying the pathology of other inherited skin fragility disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa. This article reviews the clinical features as well as the molecular and cellular pathology of Kindler syndrome and highlights the importance of the new protein, kindlin-1, in cell-matrix adhesion and its intriguing link to photosensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is an adaptor protein that is expressed by most epithelial cells and has been implicated in integrin bidirectional signaling. Mutations in the gene encoding kindlin-1 are associated with Kindler syndrome, a recessively inherited disorder that is characterized by fragile skin. Functionally, a loss of kindlin-1 impairs the adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the extracellular matrix both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we show that the phenotype of mutant keratinocytes deficient in kindlin-1 is characterized by the modification of the cortical actin network and increased plasticity of the plasma membrane. At the molecular level, expression of several proteins associated with an epithelial phenotype, such as α6β4 integrin, collagen XVII, E-cadherin, and desmoglein-3, is strongly reduced, whereas, surprisingly, laminin 332 is synthesized in larger amounts than in control keratinocytes. In contrast, mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin are increased in keratinocytes lacking kindlin-1. The switch in cell plasticity and protein expression was confirmed by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of kindlin-1 in HaCaT epithelial cells. Furthermore, there was up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines in kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes. These results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that take place in Kindler syndrome. Moreover, the constellation of molecular defects associated with the loss of kindlin-1 may explain the higher incidence of skin cancer observed in patients affected with this disorder.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kindler syndrome (KS) is a rare, inherited skin disease characterized by blister formation and generalized poikiloderma. Mutations in KIND1, which encodes kindlin-1, are responsible for KS. c.1089del/1089+1del is a recurrent splice-site deletion mutation in KS patients. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of c.1089del/1089+1del at the mRNA and protein level. METHODS: Two KS patients with c.1089del/1089+1del were included in this study. Immunofluorescence analysis of KS skin samples using antibodies against the dermo-epidermal junction proteins was performed. Exon-trapping experiments were performed to isolate the mRNA sequences transcribed from genomic DNA harbouring c.1089del/1089+1del. β1 integrin activation in HeLa cells transfected with truncated KIND1 cDNA was analyzed. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence study showed positive expression of kindlin-1 in KS skin with c.1089del/1089+1del mutation. We identified the exon-8-skipped in-frame transcript as the main product among multiple splicing variants derived from that mutation. HeLa cells transfected with KIND1 cDNA without exon 8 showed impaired β1 integrin activation. Exon-8-coding amino acids are located in the FERM F2 domain, which is conserved among species, and the unstructured region between F2 and the pleckstrin homology domain. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exon-8-skipped truncated kindlin-1 is functionally defective and does not compensate for the defects of KS, even though kindlin-1 expression in skin is positive.",

The FERMT1 mutational spectrum comprises gross genomic deletions, splice site, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which are scattered over the coding region spanning exon 2-15. We now report three KS families with mutations affecting the promoter region of FERMT1. Two of these mutations are large deletions (∼38.0 and 1.9 kb in size) and one is a single nucleotide variant (c.-20A>G) within the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Each mutation resulted in loss of gene expression in patient skin or cultured keratinocytes. Reporter assays showed the functional relevance of the genomic regions deleted in our patients for FERMT1 gene transcription and proved the causal role of the c.-20A>G variant in reducing transcriptional activity.

Early in life, KS manifests as a mechanobullous disease reflecting diminished cell adhesion, but the mechanisms of its later phenotypic features, progressive poikiloderma, and mucocutaneous fibrosis, remain elusive. The FERMT1 gene product and KS protein, kindlin-1, is an epithelial-specific phosphoprotein involved in integrin beta-1 activation, without an obvious link to dermal connective tissue. Here we show how lack of intracellular kindlin-1 in epidermal keratinocytes leads to profound changes in another skin compartment, the dermis. Kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes respond to cell stress by upregulating the expression of cytokines such as IL-20, IL-24, TGF-β2, IL1F5, PDGFB, and CTGF. These launch-via paracrine communication-an inflammatory response in the dermis, accompanied by the presence of TGF-β, IL-6, and CTGF, activation of fibroblasts and their differentiation to myofibroblasts, which secrete and deposit increased amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. These data are concordant with a model wherein repeated cycles of epidermal cell stress, cytokine secretion, dermal inflammation, and profibrotic processes underlie mucocutaneous fibrosis in KS.",

Major clinical criteria include acral blistering in infancy and childhood, progressive poikiloderma, skin atrophy, abnormal photosensitivity, and gingival fragility. METHODS: FERMT1 gene was sequenced in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Kindler syndrome. RESULTS: We report a novel pathogenic variant detected in four unrelated families of Paraguayan origin, where one nucleotide deletion in FERMT1 gene (c.450delG) is predicted to cause a frameshift mutation leading to loss of function. Haplotype analysis revealed the propagation of an ancestral allele through this population. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this recurrent pathogenic variant enables optimization of molecular detection strategies in our patients, reducing the cost of diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Mutations in the FERMT1 gene (also known as KIND1), encoding the focal adhesion protein kindlin-1, underlie the Kindler syndrome (KS), an autosomal recessive skin disorder with an intriguing progressive phenotype comprising skin blistering, photosensitivity, progressive poikiloderma with extensive skin atrophy, and propensity to skin cancer. Herein we review the clinical and genetic data of 62 patients, and delineate the natural history of the disorder, for example, age at onset of symptoms, or risk of malignancy. Although most mutations are predicted to lead to premature termination of translation, and to loss of kindlin-1 function, significant clinical variability is observed among patients. There is an association of FERMT1 missense and in-frame deletion mutations with milder disease phenotypes, and later onset of complications. Nevertheless, the clinical variability is not fully explained by genotype-phenotype correlations. Environmental factors and yet unidentified modifiers may play a role. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of KS should enable the development of prevention strategies for disease complications.",

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to β-integrin subunits and is required for integrin activation. Loss of function mutations in the FERMT1 gene which encodes Kindlin-1 leads to the development of Kindler Syndrome (KS) an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and predisposition to aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we show that loss of Kindlin-1 sensitizes both SCC cells and keratinocytes to oxidative stress: Kindlin-1 deficient cells have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, decreased viability and increased DNA damage after treatment with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or irradiation with UVA. We show that Kindlin-1 is required to fully activate ERK signalling after oxidative damage, and that activation of ERK protects cells from DNA damage following oxidative stress: inhibition of ERK activation sensitizes Kindlin-1 expressing cells, but not Kindlin-1 deficient cells to oxidative stress. Finally we demonstrate that the Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK and protection from DNA damage following oxidative stress depends on the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind integrins. Thus loss of Kindlin-1 leads to an imbalance in the cellular oxidative state, which renders Kindlin-1 deficient cells more prone to the effects of ROS generated in response to oxidative stress. We propose that Kindlin-1 dependent activation of ERK signalling is a key molecular mechanism that renders KS keratinocytes more sensitive to oxidative damage and contributes to the increased photosensitivity in KS patients.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) results from pathogenic loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, which encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton-related protein. How and why abnormalities in kindlin-1 disrupt keratinocyte cell biology in KS, however, is not yet known. In this study, we identified two previously unreported binding proteins of kindlin-1: kindlin-2 and migfilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies show that these three proteins bind to each other and colocalize at focal adhesion in HaCaT cells and normal human keratinocytes. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in KIND1 result in marked variability in kindlin-1 immunolabeling in KS skin, which is mirrored by similar changes in kindlin-2 and migfilin immunoreactivity. Kindlin-1, however, may function independently of kindlin-2 and migfilin, as loss of kindlin-1 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes by RNA interference and in KS keratinocytes does not affect KIND2 or FBLIM1 (migfilin) gene expression or kindlin-2 and migfilin protein localization. In addition to identifying protein-binding partners for kindlin-1, this study also highlights that KIND1 gene expression and kindlin-1 protein labeling are not always reduced in KS, findings that are relevant to the accurate laboratory diagnosis of this genodermatosis by skin immunohistochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by skin blistering and photosensitivity. KS is caused by loss of function mutations in FERMT1, which encodes Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1 is a FERM domain containing adaptor protein that is found predominantly at cell-extracellular matrix adhesions where it binds to integrin β subunits and is required for efficient integrin activation. Using keratinocytes derived from a patient with KS, into which wild-type Kindlin-1 (Kin1WT) has been expressed, we show that Kindlin-1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2. CDK1 and CDK2 are key regulators of cell cycle progression, however, cell cycle analysis showed only small differences between the KS and KS-Kin1WT keratinocytes. In contrast, G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was enhanced in KS keratinocytes but not KS-Kin1WT cells, following inhibition of CDK activity. Furthermore, KS keratinocytes were more sensitive to DNA damage in response to H2 O2 and this was exacerbated by treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. Thus, in Kindlin-1 deficient keratinocytes, CDK activity can further regulate oxidative damage induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. This provides further insight into the key pathways that control sensitivity to oxidative stress in KS patients.",

Most FERMT1 mutations lead to premature termination codons and absence of kindlin-1. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular consequences of a naturally occurring FERMT1 mutation, c.299_301del resulting in a single amino acid deletion, p.R100del. The mutation led to a 50% reduction of FERMT1 mRNA and 90% reduction of kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes derived from the patient, as compared with control cells. The misfolded p.R100del kindlin-1 mutant was lysosomally degraded and launched a homeostatic unfolded protein response. Sodium-phenylbutyrate significantly increased kindlin-1 mRNA and protein levels and the area of mutant cells, acting as a chemical chaperone and probably also as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In a recombinant system, low levels of wild-type or p.R100del mutant kindlin-1 were sufficient to improve the cellular phenotype in respect of spreading and proliferation as compared with kindlin-1 negative keratinocytes. The study of this hypomorphic mutation provides evidence that low amounts of kindlin-1 are sufficient to improve the epidermal architecture and Kindler syndrome cellular phenotype and proposes a personalized chaperone therapy for the patient.",

            "abstract": "Kindlin-1 is an adaptor protein that is expressed by most epithelial cells and has been implicated in integrin bidirectional signaling. Mutations in the gene encoding kindlin-1 are associated with Kindler syndrome, a recessively inherited disorder that is characterized by fragile skin. Functionally, a loss of kindlin-1 impairs the adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the extracellular matrix both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we show that the phenotype of mutant keratinocytes deficient in kindlin-1 is characterized by the modification of the cortical actin network and increased plasticity of the plasma membrane. At the molecular level, expression of several proteins associated with an epithelial phenotype, such as α6β4 integrin, collagen XVII, E-cadherin, and desmoglein-3, is strongly reduced, whereas, surprisingly, laminin 332 is synthesized in larger amounts than in control keratinocytes. In contrast, mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin are increased in keratinocytes lacking kindlin-1. The switch in cell plasticity and protein expression was confirmed by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of kindlin-1 in HaCaT epithelial cells. Furthermore, there was up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines in kindlin-1-deficient keratinocytes. These results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that take place in Kindler syndrome. Moreover, the constellation of molecular defects associated with the loss of kindlin-1 may explain the higher incidence of skin cancer observed in patients affected with this disorder.",

The Kindlin-1-related diseases are confined in limited tissue types. However, Kindlin-1 tissue distribution and the dogma that governs Kindlin-1 expression in normal human body are elusive. This study examined Kindlin-1 expression in normal human adult organs, human and mouse embryonic organs by immunohistochemical analyses. We identified a general principle that the level of Kindlin-1 expression in tissues is tightly correlated with the corresponding germ layers from which these tissues originate. We compared the expression of Kindlin-1 with Kindlin-2 and found that Kindlin-1 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues derived from ectoderm and endoderm, whereas Kindlin-2 is mainly expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues. Likewise, Kindlin-1 was also found highly expressed in endoderm/ectoderm-derived tissues in human and mouse embryos. Our findings indicate that Kindlin-1 may play an importance role in the development of endoderm/ectoderm related tissues. ",

Ultrastructural examination reveals marked basement membrane reduplication and variable levels of cleavage at the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular pathology underlying Kindler syndrome has recently been shown to involve loss-of-function mutations in a novel gene, KIND1, encoding kindlin-1. Immunofluorescence, gene expression and cell biology studies have shown that kindlin-1 is expressed mainly in basal keratinocytes and plays a role in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton via focal contacts to the extracellular matrix. Thus, Kindler syndrome is the first genodermatosis caused by a defect in actin-extracellular matrix linkage rather than the classic keratin-extracellular matrix linkage underlying the pathology of other inherited skin fragility disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa. This article reviews the clinical features as well as the molecular and cellular pathology of Kindler syndrome and highlights the importance of the new protein, kindlin-1, in cell-matrix adhesion and its intriguing link to photosensitivity.",

Kindlin-1 and -2 are expressed in the skin, but whether and how they cooperate in adult epithelial cells have remained elusive. We uncovered the overlapping roles of kindlin-1 and -2 in maintaining epithelial integrity and show that the phenotype of kindlin-1-deficient cells can be modulated by regulating kindlin-2 gene expression and vice versa. The experimental evidence is provided by use of human keratinocyte cell lines that express both kindlins, just kindlin-1 or kindlin-2, or none of them. Double deficiency of kindlin-1 and -2 had significant negative effects on focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, survival, directional migration, and activation of β(1) integrin, whereas deficiency of one kindlin only showed variable perturbation of these functions. Cell motility and formation of cell-cell contacts were particularly affected by lack of kindlin-2. These results predict that kindlin-1 and -2 can functionally compensate for each other, at least in part. The high physiologic and pathologic significance of the compensation was emphasized by the discovery of environmental regulation of kindlin-2 expression. UV-B irradiation induced loss of kindlin-2 in keratinocytes. This first example of environmental regulation of kindlin expression has implications for phenotype modulation in Kindler syndrome, a skin disorder caused by kindlin-1 deficiency.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Kindler syndrome (KS) have loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene that encodes the focal adhesion component kindlin-1. The major clinical manifestation of KS is epidermal atrophy (premature skin ageing). This phenotypic feature is thought to be related to the decreased proliferation rate of KS keratinocytes; nevertheless, molecular mediators of such abnormal behaviour have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how kindlin-1 deficiency affects the proliferative potential of primary human keratinocytes. METHODS: We serially cultivated nine primary KS keratinocyte strains until senescence and determined their lifespan and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) at each serial passage. The expression of molecular markers of stemness and cellular senescence were investigated by immunoblotting using cell extracts of primary keratinocyte cultures from patients with KS and healthy donors. In another set of experiments, kindlin-1 downregulation in normal keratinocytes was obtained by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. RESULTS: We found that KS keratinocytes exhibited a precocious senescence and strongly reduced clonogenic potential. Moreover, KS cultures showed a strikingly increased percentage of aborted colonies (paraclones) already at early passages indicating an early depletion of stem cells. Immunoblotting analysis of KS keratinocyte extracts showed reduced levels of the stemness markers p63 and Bmi-1, upregulation of p16 and scant amounts of hypophosphorylated Rb protein, which indicated cell cycle-arrested status. Treatment of normal human primary keratinocytes with siRNA targeting kindlin-1 proved that its deficiency was directly responsible for p63, Bmi-1 and pRb downregulation and p16 induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data directly implicate kindlin-1 in preventing premature senescence of keratinocytes.",

Although Kindler syndrome is classified as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, it has distinct clinicopathological and molecular abnormalities. The molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in a newly recognized actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, now known as fermitin family homologue 1, encoded by the gene FERMT1. This protein mediates anchorage between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions, and thus the structural pathology differs from other forms of epidermolysis bullosa in which there is a disruption of the keratin intermediate filament-hemidesmosome network and the extracellular matrix. In the skin, fermitin family homologue 1 is mainly expressed in basal keratinocytes and binds to the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 and beta3 integrins as well as to fermitin family homologue 2 and filamin-binding LIM protein 1. It also plays a crucial role in keratinocyte migration, proliferation and adhesion. In this report, we review the clinical, cellular and molecular pathology of Kindler syndrome and discuss the role of fermitin family homologue 1 in keratinocyte biology.",

            "abstract": "Spontaneous gene repair, also called revertant mosaicism, has been documented in several genetic disorders involving organs that undergo self-regeneration, including the skin. Genetic reversion may occur through different mechanisms, and in a single individual, the mutation can be repaired in various ways. Here we describe a disseminated pattern of revertant mosaicism observed in 6 patients with Kindler syndrome (KS), a genodermatosis caused by loss of kindlin-1 (encoded by FERMT1) and clinically characterized by patchy skin pigmentation and atrophy. All patients presented duplication mutations (c.456dupA and c.676dupC) in FERMT1, and slipped mispairing in direct nucleotide repeats was identified as the reversion mechanism in all investigated revertant skin spots. The sequence around the mutations demonstrated high propensity to mutations, favoring both microinsertions and microdeletions. Additionally, in some revertant patches, mitotic recombination generated areas with homozygous normal keratinocytes. Restoration of kindlin-1 expression led to clinically and structurally normal skin. Since loss of kindlin-1 severely impairs keratinocyte proliferation, we predict that revertant cells have a selective advantage that allows their clonal expansion and, consequently, the improvement of the skin condition.",

We report a novel kindlin-1-deficient keratinocyte cell line derived from a Kindler syndrome patient. Despite the expression of kindlin-2, the patient's cells display several hallmarks related to reduced function of β1 integrins, including abnormal cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and cell migration. Defective cell adhesion was aggravated by kindlin-2 depletion, indicating that kindlin-2 can compensate to a certain extent for the loss of kindlin-1. Intriguingly, β1 at the cell-surface was aberrantly glycosylated in the patient's cells, and its expression was considerably reduced, both in cells in vitro and in the patient's epidermis. Reconstitution with wild-type kindlin-1 but not with a β1-binding defective mutant restored the aberrant β1 expression and glycosylation, and normalized cell morphology, adhesion, spreading, and migration. Furthermore, the expression of wild-type kindlin-1, but not of the integrin-binding-defective mutant, increased the stability of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and enhanced the redistribution of internalized integrins to the cell surface. Thus, these data uncover a role for kindlin-1 in the regulation of integrin trafficking and adhesion turnover.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT1. This gene encodes kindlin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in activation of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin-1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and migration. Electric fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin-1 but not a W612A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin-1 was also required for the maintenance of lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin-1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology.",

Fewer than 100 cases have been described in the literature. First reported in 1954, the molecular basis of Kindler syndrome was elucidated in 2003 with the discovery of FERMT1 (KIND1) loss-of-function mutations in affected individuals. The FERMT1 gene encodes kindlin-1 (also known as fermitin family homologue 1), a 77 kDa protein that localizes at focal adhesions, where it plays an important role in integrin signalling. In the current study, we describe five novel and three recurrent loss-of-function FERMT1 mutations in eight individuals with Kindler syndrome, and provide an overview of genotype-phenotype correlation in this disorder.",

            "abstract": "Kindler syndrome (KS), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder comprises mechanical skin fragility and photosensitivity, which manifest early in life. The progression of the disorder is irreversible and results in tissue damage in form of cutaneous and mucosal atrophy and scarring and epithelial cancers. Here, we unravel molecular mechanisms of increased UV-B sensitivity of keratinocytes derived from KS patients. We show that the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-α, are upregulated in KS skin and in UV-B irradiated KS keratinocytes. These cytokines are dependent on p38 activation, which is increased in the absence of kindlin-1 and induced by higher ROS levels. Other dysregulated cytokines and growth factors were identified in this study and might be involved in paracrine interactions contributing to KS pathology. We show a direct relationship between kindlin-1 abundance and UV-B induced apoptosis in keratinocytes, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression has no compensatory effect. Importantly, low levels of kindlin-1 are sufficient to relieve or rescue this feature. Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of UV-B induced apoptosis is a valid therapeutic goal to influence long term complications of KS. Here, we demonstrate that antioxidants and the plant flavonoid luteolin represent feasible topical therapeutic approaches decreasing UV-B induced apoptosis in two-dimensional and organotypic KS cultures. We provide evidence for potential new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the progressive course of KS, for which no cure is available to date. Furthermore, we established organotypic KS models, a valuable in vitro tool for research with a morphology similar to the skin of patients in situ.",
