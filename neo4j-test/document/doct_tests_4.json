            "Abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5β and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Talin, a force-bearing cytoplasmic adapter essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, links the actin cytoskeleton to integrin-based cell-extracellular matrix adhesions at the plasma membrane. Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

In the era of integrative structural biology, one way of increasing the accuracy of modeling methods used to predict the structure of biomolecular complexes is to include as much experimental or predictive information as possible in the process. This has been at the core of our information-driven docking approach HADDOCK. We present here the updated version 2.2 of the HADDOCK portal, which offers new features such as support for mixed molecule types, additional experimental restraints and improved protocols, all of this in a user-friendly interface. With well over 6000 registered users and 108,000 jobs served, an increasing fraction of which on grid resources, we hope that this timely upgrade will help the community to solve important biological questions and further advance the field. The HADDOCK2.2 Web server is freely accessible to non-profit users at http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2. ",

            "abstract": "A fundamental question in mechanobiology is how mechanical stimuli are sensed by mechanosensing proteins and converted into signals that direct cells to adapt to the external environment. A key function of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is to transduce mechanical forces between cells and their extracellular environment. Talin, a cytoplasmic adapter essential for integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM, links the actin cytoskeleton to integrin at the plasma membrane. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of talin-dependent mechanosensing revealed by stretching single talin molecules. Rapid progress in single-molecule force manipulation technologies has made it possible to directly study the impact of mechanical force on talin's conformations and its interactions with other signaling proteins. We also provide our views on how findings from such studies may bring new insights into understanding the principles of mechanobiology on a broader scale, and how such fundamental knowledge may be harnessed for mechanopharmacology.",

            "abstract": "Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a frequent cause of progressive renal function decline and affects millions of people. In a recent study, 30% of SRNS cases evaluated were the result of monogenic mutations in 1 of 27 different genes. Here, using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified recessive mutations in kidney ankyrin repeat-containing protein 1 (KANK1), KANK2, and KANK4 in individuals with nephrotic syndrome. In an independent functional genetic screen of Drosophila cardiac nephrocytes, which are equivalents of mammalian podocytes, we determined that the Drosophila KANK homolog (dKank) is essential for nephrocyte function. RNAi-mediated knockdown of dKank in nephrocytes disrupted slit diaphragm filtration structures and lacuna channel structures. In rats, KANK1, KANK2, and KANK4 all localized to podocytes in glomeruli, and KANK1 partially colocalized with synaptopodin. Knockdown of kank2 in zebrafish recapitulated a nephrotic syndrome phenotype, resulting in proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement. In rat glomeruli and cultured human podocytes, KANK2 interacted with ARHGDIA, a known regulator of RHO GTPases in podocytes that is dysfunctional in some types of nephrotic syndrome. Knockdown of KANK2 in cultured podocytes increased active GTP-bound RHOA and decreased migration. Together, these data suggest that KANK family genes play evolutionarily conserved roles in podocyte function, likely through regulating RHO GTPase signaling. ",

It details each of the stages from generating NMR restraints [distance, dihedral, hydrogen bonds and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs)], exporting these to and subsequently re-importing them from structure-calculation software (such as the programs CYANA or ARIA) and analysing and validating the results obtained from the structure calculation to, ultimately, the streamlined deposition of the completed assignments and the refined ensemble of structures into the PDBe repository. Until recently, such solution-structure determination by NMR has been quite a laborious task, requiring multiple stages and programs. However, with the new enhancements to CcpNmr Analysis described here, this process is now much more intuitive and efficient and less error-prone. ",

A global view of how activation state converts the molecular composition of the region proximal to integrins into functional readouts is, however, lacking. Here, using conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, we report the isolation of integrin activation state-dependent complexes and their characterization by mass spectrometry. Quantitative comparisons, integrating network, clustering, pathway and image analyses, define multiple functional protein modules enriched in a conformation-specific manner. Notably, active integrin complexes are specifically enriched for proteins associated with microtubule-based functions. Visualization of microtubules on micropatterned surfaces and live cell imaging demonstrate that active integrins establish an environment that stabilizes microtubules at the cell periphery. These data provide a resource for the interrogation of the global molecular connections that link integrin activation to adhesion signalling. ",

            "abstract": "A hallmark of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the high density of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic muscle membrane. The postsynaptic apparatus of the NMJ is organized by agrin secreted from motor neurons. The mechanisms that underlie the focal delivery of AChRs to the adult NMJ are not yet understood in detail. We previously showed that microtubule (MT) capture by the plus end-tracking protein CLASP2 regulates AChR density at agrin-induced AChR clusters in cultured myotubes via PI3 kinase acting through GSK3β. Here we show that knockdown of the CLASP2-interaction partner LL5β by RNAi and forced expression of a CLASP2 fragment blocking the CLASP2/LL5β interaction inhibit microtubule capture. The same treatments impair focal vesicle delivery to the clusters. Consistent with these findings, knockdown of LL5β at the NMJ in vivo reduces the density and insertion of AChRs into the postsynaptic membrane. MT capture and focal vesicle delivery to agrin-induced AChR clusters are also inhibited by microtubule- and actin-depolymerizing drugs, invoking both cytoskeletal systems in MT capture and in the fusion of AChR vesicles with the cluster membrane. Combined our data identify a transport system, organized by agrin through PI3 kinase, GSK3β, CLASP2, and LL5β, for precise delivery of AChR vesicles from the subsynaptic nuclei to the overlying synaptic membrane.

By exploring underlying mechanisms, we further show that MAP4K4 associates with ending binding 2 (EB2) and IQ motif and SEC7 domain-containing protein 1 (IQSEC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Arf6, whose activation promotes integrin internalization. Together, our findings provide critical insight into FA disassembly, suggesting that MTs can deliver MAP4K4 toward FAs through EB2, where MAP4K4 can, in turn, activate Arf6 via IQSEC1 and enhance FA dissolution.",

            "abstract": "The postsynaptic apparatus of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) traps and anchors acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at high density at the synapse. We have previously shown that microtubule (MT) capture by CLASP2, a MT plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP), increases the size and receptor density of AChR clusters at the NMJ through the delivery of AChRs and that this is regulated by a pathway involving neuronal agrin and several postsynaptic kinases, including GSK3. Phosphorylation by GSK3 has been shown to cause CLASP2 dissociation from MT ends, and nine potential phosphorylation sites for GSK3 have been mapped on CLASP2. How CLASP2 phosphorylation regulates MT capture at the NMJ and how this controls the size of AChR clusters are not yet understood. To examine this, we used myotubes cultured on agrin patches that induce AChR clustering in a two-dimensional manner. We show that expression of a CLASP2 mutant, in which the nine GSK3 target serines are mutated to alanine (CLASP2-9XS/9XA) and are resistant to GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, promotes MT capture at clusters and increases AChR cluster size, compared with myotubes that express similar levels of wild type CLASP2 or that are noninfected. Conversely, myotubes expressing a phosphomimetic form of CLASP2 (CLASP2-8XS/D) show enrichment of immobile mutant CLASP2 in clusters, but MT capture and AChR cluster size are reduced. Taken together, our data suggest that both GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation and the level of CLASP2 play a role in the maintenance of AChR cluster size through the regulated capture and release of MT plus-ends.

The knowledge of the molecular mechanisms required to achieve such coordination is fragmentary. Here, we identify a new functional complex that drives cell motility. ERC1a (an isoform of ERC1) and the LL5 proteins LL5α and LL5β (encoded by PHLDB1 and PHLDB2, respectively) are required, together with liprin-α1, for effective migration and tumor cell invasion, and do so by stabilizing the protrusive activity at the cell front. Depletion of either protein negatively affects invasion, migration on extracellular matrix, lamellipodial persistence and the internalization of active integrin β1 receptors needed for adhesion turnover at the front of the cell. Liprin-α1, ERC1a and LL5 also define new highly polarized and dynamic cytoplasmic structures uniquely localized near the protruding cell edge. Our results indicate that the functional complex and the associated structures described here represent an important mechanism to drive tumor cell migration. ",

LD motifs are required for embryogenesis, wound healing and the evolution of multicellularity. LD motifs also play roles in disease, such as in cancer metastasis or viral infection. First described in the paxillin family of scaffolding proteins, LD motifs and similar acidic LXXLL interaction motifs have been discovered in several other proteins, whereas 16 proteins have been reported to contain LDBDs (LD motif-binding domains). Collectively, structural and functional analyses have revealed a surprising multivalency in LD motif interactions and a wide diversity in LDBD architectures. In the present review, we summarize the molecular basis for function, regulation and selectivity of LD motif interactions that has emerged from more than a decade of research. This overview highlights the intricate multi-level regulation and the inherently noisy and heterogeneous nature of signalling through short protein-protein interaction motifs.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

Here we use magnetic tweezers to characterise the mechano-sensitive compact N-terminal region of the talin rod, and show that the three helical bundles R1-R3 in this region unfold in three distinct steps consistent with the domains unfolding independently. Mechanical stretching of talin R1-R3 enhances its binding to vinculin and vinculin binding inhibits talin refolding after force is released. Mutations that stabilize R3 identify it as the initial mechano-sensing domain in talin, unfolding at ∼5 pN, suggesting that 5 pN is the force threshold for vinculin binding and adhesion progression.

Recent experiments have shed light on the cell size-dependent assembly of membrane-less cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic structures, including ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules and other intracellular bodies. Many of these structures behave as condensed liquid-like phases of the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm. The phase transitions that appear to govern their assembly exhibit an intrinsic dependence on cell size, and may explain the size scaling reported for a number of structures. This size scaling could, in turn, play a role in cell growth and size control. ",

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

Molecular regulation of gastrulation EMT is poorly understood. Here we show that epiblast epithelial status was maintained by anchoring microtubules to the basal cortex via CLIP-associated protein (CLASP), a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, and Dystroglycan, a transmembrane protein that bridges the cytoskeleton and basement membrane (BM). Mesoderm formation required down-regulation of CLASP and Dystroglycan, and reducing CLASP activity in pregastrulation epiblast cells caused ectopic BM breakdown and disrupted epiblast integrity. These effects were mediated through the CLASP-binding partner LL5. Live-imaging using EB1-enhanced GFP (eGFP) revealed that reducing CLASP and LL5 levels in the epiblast destabilized basal microtubules. We further show that Dystroglycan is localized to basolateral membrane in epiblast cells. Basal but not lateral localization of Dystroglycan was regulated by CLASP. We propose that epiblast-BM interaction requires CLASP- and Dystroglycan-mediated cortical microtubule anchoring, the disruption of which initiates gastrulation EMT. ",

Talins and kindlins, two families of FERM-domain proteins, bind the cytoplasmic tail of integrins, recruit cytoskeletal and signalling proteins involved in mechanotransduction and synergize to activate integrin binding to extracellular ligands. New data reveal the domain structure of full-length talin, provide insights into talin-mediated integrin activation and show that RIAM recruits talin to the plasma membrane, whereas vinculin stabilizes talin in cell-matrix junctions. How kindlins act is less well-defined, but disease-causing mutations show that kindlins are also essential for integrin activation, adhesion, cell spreading and signalling. ",

We previously showed that podosomes, actin-rich adhesive organelles, promote the remodeling process, and demonstrated a key role for one podosome component, LL5β. To further investigate molecular mechanisms of postsynaptic maturation, we purified LL5β-associated proteins from myotubes and showed that three regulators of the actin cytoskeleton--Amotl2, Asef2 and Flii--interact with LL5β. These and other LL5β-interacting proteins are associated with conventional podosomes in macrophages and podosome-like invadopodia in fibroblasts, strengthening the close relationship between synaptic and non-synaptic podosomes. We then focused on Amotl2, showing that it is associated with synaptic podosomes in cultured myotubes and with NMJs in vivo. Depletion of Amotl2 in myotubes leads to increased size of synaptic podosomes and corresponding alterations in postsynaptic topology. Depletion of Amotl2 from fibroblasts disrupts invadopodia in these cells. These results demonstrate a role for Amotl2 in synaptic maturation and support the involvement of podosomes in this process.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

Here, we show that the microtubule motor Kif1C contributes to persistent cell migration primarily through stabilization of an extended cell rear. Kif1C-mediated transport of α5β1-integrins is required for the proper maturation of trailing focal adhesions and resistance to tail retraction. Tail retraction precedes and induces changes in migration direction. Stabilization of cell tails through inhibition of myosin II activity suppresses the Kif1C depletion phenotype and results in longer-lived tails and higher directional stability of migrating cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the maintenance of an extended, tense cell tail facilitates directional migration. We propose a rear drag mechanism for directional persistence of migration whereby the counterforce originating from a well-anchored tail serves to maintain directionality of the force-generating leading edge of the cell.",

Normal FA turnover requires dynamic microtubules, and three members of the diverse group of microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins are principally involved in mediating microtubule interactions with FAs. Microtubules also alter the assembly state of FAs by modulating Rho GTPase signaling, and recent evidence suggests that microtubule-mediated clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis regulates FA dynamics. In addition, FA-associated microtubules may provide a polarized microtubule track for localized secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Thus, different aspects of the molecular mechanisms by which microtubules control FA turnover in migrating cells are beginning to emerge.",

            "abstract": "Agrin is the major factor mediating the neuronal regulation of postsynaptic structures at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, but the details of how it orchestrates this unique three-dimensional structure remain unknown. Here, we show that agrin induces the formation of the dense network of microtubules in the subsynaptic cytoplasm and that this, in turn, regulates acetylcholine receptor insertion into the postsynaptic membrane. Agrin acted in part by locally activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and inactivating GSK3β, which led to the local capturing of dynamic microtubules at agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters, mediated to a large extent by the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins CLASP2 and CLIP-170. Indeed, in the absence of CLASP2, microtubule plus ends at the subsynaptic muscle membrane, the density of synaptic AChRs, the size of AChR clusters, and the numbers of subsynaptic muscle nuclei with their selective gene expression programs were all reduced. Thus, the cascade linking agrin to CLASP2-mediated microtubule capturing at the synaptic membrane is essential for the maintenance of a normal neuromuscular phenotype.",

            "abstract": "The formation of tissues and organs requires cells to adhere to each other and/or to migrate and polarize in contact with components of the extracellular matrix. The connection between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment is provided by heterodimeric transmembrane receptors of the integrin family. In response to extracellular ligand binding, integrins undergo a conformational switch that permits the recruitment of cytoplasmic adapter proteins, eventually linking the integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, progressively forming highly complex cell-matrix adhesions. A major challenge in the field consists in identifying the regulatory mechanisms, which drive the assembly of cell-matrix adhesions as they are based on posttranslational modifications as well as allosteric conformational changes caused by protein-protein as well as protein-lipid interactions. In response to mechanical tension, generated either by intra-cellular acto-myosin contraction, shear stress or mechanical strain on the extracellular scaffold, the composition and signaling of cell-matrix adhesion changes, leading either to increased anchorage or controlled disassembly of cell matrix adhesions, both processes critically involved in cell migration. The aim of this review is to provide insight into the mechanisms leading to the progressive assembly of focal adhesions, how they are modulated in response to mechanical challenges and which mechanisms are used for their disassembly.",

            "abstract": "Talin, which is composed of head (THD) and rod domains, plays an important role in cell adhesion events in diverse species including most metazoans and Dictyostelium discoideum. Talin is abundant in the cytosol; however, it mediates adhesion by associating with integrins in the plasma membrane where it forms a primary link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells modulate the partitioning of talin between the plasma membrane and the cytosol to control cell adhesion. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or its localization to the plasma membrane. An interaction between a discrete vinculin-binding region of the rod (VBS1/2a; Tln1(482-787)), and the THD restrains talin from interacting with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that vinculin binding to VBS1/2a results in talin recruitment to the plasma membrane. Thus, we have structurally defined specific inter-domain interactions between THD and the talin rod domain that regulate the subcellular localization of talin.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion composition and size are modulated in a myosin II-dependent maturation process that controls adhesion, migration, and matrix remodeling. As myosin II activity drives stress fiber assembly and enhanced tension at adhesions simultaneously, the extent to which adhesion maturation is driven by tension or altered actin architecture is unknown. We show that perturbations to formin and α-actinin 1 activity selectively inhibited stress fiber assembly at adhesions but retained a contractile lamella that generated large tension on adhesions. Despite relatively unperturbed adhesion dynamics and force transmission, impaired stress fiber assembly impeded focal adhesion compositional maturation and fibronectin remodeling. Finally, we show that compositional maturation of focal adhesions could occur even when myosin II-dependent cellular tension was reduced by 80%. We propose that stress fiber assembly at the adhesion site serves as a structural template that facilitates adhesion maturation over a wide range of tensions. This work identifies the essential role of lamellar actin architecture in adhesion maturation.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Regulated neurotransmitter release from presynaptic boutons is crucial for the functioning of chemical synapses, what in turn governs the functional performance of the nervous system. Release occurs at the active zone (AZ), a specialized region of the presynaptic plasma membrane that is defined by a unique and complex meshwork of proteins--the cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ). Important functions of CAZ proteins include recruitment, docking and priming of synaptic vesicles as well as appropriate localization of voltage-gated calcium channels near vesicle docking sites. We will discuss recent progress in the understanding of the topological localization and the molecular functions of characteristic CAZ proteins as well as emerging molecular mechanisms underlying presynaptic plasticity that involve significant structural CAZ remodeling.",

One of the major functions of microtubules is the control of polarized cell motility. In order to support the asymmetry of polarized cells, microtubules have to be organized asymmetrically themselves. Asymmetry in microtubule distribution and stability is regulated by multiple molecular factors, most of which are microtubule-associated proteins that locally control microtubule nucleation and dynamics. At the same time, the dynamic state of microtubules is key to the regulatory mechanisms by which microtubules regulate cell polarity, modulate cell adhesion and control force-production by the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we propose that even small alterations in microtubule dynamics can influence cell migration via several different microtubule-dependent pathways. We discuss regulatory factors, potential feedback mechanisms due to functional microtubule-actin crosstalk and implications for cancer cell motility.",

            "abstract": "Rab6 is a conserved small GTPase that localizes to the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles and controls transport and fusion of secretory carriers [1]. Another Rab implicated in trafficking from the trans-Golgi to the plasma membrane is Rab8 [2-5]. Here we show that Rab8A stably associates with exocytotic vesicles in a Rab6-dependent manner. Rab8A function is not needed for budding or motility of exocytotic carriers but is required for their docking and fusion. These processes also depend on the Rab6-interacting cortical factor ELKS [1], suggesting that Rab8A and ELKS act in the same pathway. We show that Rab8A and ELKS can be linked by MICAL3, a member of the MICAL family of flavoprotein monooxygenases [6]. Expression of a MICAL3 mutant with an inactive monooxygenase domain resulted in a strong accumulation of secretory vesicles that were docked at the cell cortex but failed to fuse with the plasma membrane, an effect that correlated with the strongly reduced mobility of MICAL3. We propose that the monooxygenase activity of MICAL3 is required to regulate its own turnover and the concomitant remodeling of vesicle-docking protein complexes in which it is engaged. Taken together, the results of our study illustrate cooperation of two Rab proteins in constitutive exocytosis and implicates a redox enzyme in this process.",

            "abstract": "Large gaps in basement membrane occur at sites of cell invasion and tissue remodelling in development and cancer. Though never followed directly in vivo, basement membrane dissolution or reduced synthesis have been postulated to create these gaps. Using landmark photobleaching and optical highlighting of laminin and type IV collagen, we find that a new mechanism, basement membrane sliding, underlies basement membrane gap enlargement during uterine-vulval attachment in Caenorhabditis elegans. Laser ablation and mutant analysis reveal that the invaginating vulval cells promote basement membrane movement. Further, an RNA interference and expression screen identifies the integrin INA-1/PAT-3 and VAB-19, homologue of the tumour suppressor Kank, as regulators of basement membrane opening. Both concentrate within vulval cells at the basement membrane gap boundary and halt expansion of the shifting basement membrane. Basement membrane sliding followed by targeted adhesion represents a new mechanism for creating precise basement membrane breaches that can be used by cells to break down compartment boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Despite its frequent inactivation in human breast cancers, the role of p21(Cip1) (p21) in morphological plasticity of normal mammary epithelial cells is still poorly understood. To address this question, we have investigated the consequences of p21 silencing in two-dimensional (2D) morphogenesis of untransformed human mammary epithelial cells. Here we show that p21 inactivation causes a reduction of 2D cell spreading and suppresses focal adhesion. In order to investigate the cytoskeletal modifications associated with this altered morphology, we have analyzed the microtubule dynamics in interphase p21-depleted cells. Our results demonstrate that interphase microtubule dynamic instability is strongly increased by p21 silencing. This alteration correlates with severe microtubule hypoacetylation. Next, we show that these microtubule defects in p21-depleted cells can be reversed by the use of the small molecule tubacin, a specific inhibitor of the α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6. Tubacin-induced microtubule dynamics decrease also correlates with a partial recovery of cell spreading and focal adhesion in those cells. Collectively, these data indicate that p21 regulates the morphological plasticity of normal mammary epithelial cells by modulating dynamics of key cytoskeletal components.",

For most cells in most environments, movement begins with protrusion of the cell membrane followed by the formation of new adhesions at the cell front that link the actin cytoskeleton to the substratum, generation of traction forces that move the cell forwards and disassembly of adhesions at the cell rear. Adhesion formation and disassembly drive the migration cycle by activating Rho GTPases, which in turn regulate actin polymerization and myosin II activity, and therefore adhesion dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

It belongs to a protein family with the protein ELKS being its close relative. In nerve terminals, these proteins are specifically localized in the active zone (AZ). They have been shown to directly interact with other AZ proteins, including RIM1, Piccolo and Bassoon, and indirectly with Munc13-1 through RIM1, forming a large molecular complex at AZ. Moreover, the direct interaction of CAST with RIM1 and Bassoon appears to be involved in the release of neurotransmitters. However, it still remains elusive how CAST and ELKS regulate the assembly and function of AZ during synapse maturation. This review focuses on recent findings about the ELKS/CAST family revealed by biochemical strategies and genetic studies, and discusses the potential roles of this protein family in the function and organization of the presynaptic AZ.",

In this study, we show that LL5beta and its homologue LL5alpha (LL5s) colocalize with autocrine laminin-5 and its receptors, integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4, at the basal side of fully polarized epithelial sheets. Depletion of both laminin receptor integrins abolishes the cortical localization of LL5s, whereas LL5 depletion reduces the amount of integrin alpha3 at the basal cell cortex. Activation of integrin alpha3 is sufficient to initiate LL5 accumulation at the cell cortex. LL5s form a complex with the cytoplasmic tails of these integrins, but their interaction might be indirect. Analysis of the three-dimensional distribution of microtubule growth by visualizing EB1-GFP in epithelial sheets in combination with RNA interference reveals that LL5s are required to maintain the density of growing microtubules selectively at the basal cortex. These findings reveal that signaling from laminin-integrin associations attaches microtubule plus ends to the epithelial basal cell cortex.",

            "abstract": "A critical step in synapse formation is the clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, directly opposite the nerve terminal. At the neuromuscular junction, a widely studied model synapse, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) initially aggregate to form an ovoid postsynaptic plaque. As the synapse matures, the plaque becomes perforated and is eventually transformed into a complex, branched structure. We found that this transformation also occurs in myotubes cultured in the absence of neurons, and used this system to seek machinery that orchestrates postsynaptic maturation. We show that perforations in the AChR aggregate bear structures resembling podosomes, dynamic actin-rich adhesive organelles involved in matrix remodeling in non-neuronal cells but not described in neural structures. The location and dynamics of synaptic podosomes are spatiotemporally correlated with changes in AChR aggregate topology, and pharmacological disruption of podosomes leads to rapid alterations in AChR organization. Our results indicate that synaptic podosomes play critical roles in maturation of the postsynaptic membrane.",

Here, we report the first structure of talin bound to an authentic full-length beta integrin tail. Using biophysical and whole cell measurements, we show that a specific ionic interaction between the talin F3 domain and the membrane-proximal helix of the beta tail disrupts an integrin alpha/beta salt bridge that helps maintain the integrin inactive state. Second, we identify a positively charged surface on the talin F2 domain that precisely orients talin to disrupt the heterodimeric integrin transmembrane (TM) complex. These results show key structural features that explain the ability of talin to mediate inside-out TM signalling.",

Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) associate with growing microtubule plus ends and control microtubule dynamics and interactions with different cellular structures during cell division, migration, and morphogenesis. EB1 and its homologs are highly conserved proteins that play an important role in the targeting of +TIPs to microtubule ends, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. By using live cell experiments and in vitro reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that a short polypeptide motif, Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP), is used by numerous +TIPs, including the tumor suppressor APC, the transmembrane protein STIM1, and the kinesin MCAK, for localization to microtubule tips in an EB1-dependent manner. Structural and biochemical data reveal the molecular basis of the EB1-SxIP interaction and explain its negative regulation by phosphorylation. Our findings establish a general \"microtubule tip localization signal\" (MtLS) and delineate a unifying mechanism for this subcellular protein targeting process.",

For efficient movement, these processes must be spatiotemporally coordinated. To a large degree, the morphological changes and physical forces that occur during migration are generated by a dynamic filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. Adhesion is regulated by dynamic assemblies of structural and signaling proteins that couple the F-actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Here, we review current knowledge of the dynamic organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in cell migration and the regulation of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly with an emphasis on how mechanical and biochemical signaling between these two systems regulate the coordination of physical processes in cell migration.",

Kank1, which regulates actin polymerization, cell migration and neurite outgrowth, interacted with the third and fourth coiled-coil domains of KIF21A protein at its ankyrin-repeat domain. While both KIF21A(R954W) and KIF21A(M947T) enhanced the formation of a heterodimer with the wild type, KIF21A(WT), these mutants also enhanced the interaction with Kank1. Knockdown of KIF21A resulted in Kank1 predominantly occurring in the cytosolic fraction, while KIF21A(WT) slightly enhanced the translocation of Kank1 to the membrane fraction. Moreover, KIF21A(R954W) significantly enhanced the translocation of Kank1 to the membrane fraction. These results suggest that KIF21A regulates the distribution of Kank1 and that KIF21A mutations associated with CFEOM1 enhanced the accumulation of Kank1 in the membrane fraction. This might cause an abrogation of neuronal development in cases of CFEOM1 through over-regulation of actin polymerization by Kank1.",

We show that mechanical stretching of single cytoplasmic proteins can activate binding of other molecules. We used magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy to investigate the effect of force on the interaction between talin, a protein that links liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system, molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system. Such protein stretching may be a more general mechanism for force transduction.",

Components of adhesion sites can interact directly with microtubules or with proteins that specifically associate with microtubule plus ends and minus ends and in this way capture, stabilize or destabilize microtubules. In their turn, microtubules can serve as routes for delivery of structural and regulatory factors that control adhesion site turnover. In addition, the microtubule lattice or growing microtubule plus ends can serve as diffusional sinks that accumulate and scaffold regulatory molecules, thereby affecting their activity in the vicinity of adhesions. Combination of these mechanisms underlies the functional co-operation between microtubules and adhesion sites and defines their dynamic behavior.",

Kank specifically inhibits the binding of IRSp53 with active Rac1 (Rac1(G12V)) but not Cdc42 (cdc42(G12V)) and thus inhibits the IRSp53-dependent development of lamellipodia without affecting the formation of filopodia. Knockdown (KD) of Kank by RNA interference results in increased lamellipodial development, whereas KD of both Kank and IRSp53 has little effect. Moreover, insulin-induced membrane ruffling is inhibited by overexpression of Kank. Kank also suppresses integrin-dependent cell spreading and IRSp53-induced neurite outgrowth. Our results demonstrate that Kank negatively regulates the formation of lamellipodia by inhibiting the interaction between Rac1 and IRSp53.",

Here, we find that Kank is an Akt substrate located downstream of PI3K and a 14-3-3-binding protein. The interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 is regulated by insulin and EGF and is mediated through phosphorylation of Kank by Akt. In NIH3T3 cells expressing Kank, the amount of actin stress fibers is reduced, and the coexpression of 14-3-3 disrupted this effect. Kank also inhibits insulin-induced cell migration via 14-3-3 binding. Furthermore, Kank inhibits insulin and active Akt-dependent activation of RhoA through binding to 14-3-3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Kank negatively regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and cell migration through the inhibition of RhoA activity, which is controlled by binding of Kank to 14-3-3 in PI3K-Akt signaling.",

            "abstract": "Synapses are specialized communication junctions between neurons whose plasticity provides the structural and functional basis for information processing and storage in the brain. Recent biochemical, genetic and imaging studies in diverse model systems are beginning to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which synaptic vesicles, ion channels, receptors and other synaptic components assemble to make a functional synapse. Recent evidence has shown that the formation and function of synapses are critically regulated by the liprin-alpha family of scaffolding proteins. The liprin-alphas have been implicated in pre- and post-synaptic development by recruiting synaptic proteins and regulating synaptic cargo transport. Here, we will summarize the diversity of liprin binding partners, highlight the factors that control the function of liprin-alphas at the synapse and discuss how liprin-alpha family proteins regulate synapse formation and synaptic transmission.",

This process is mediated by vesicles, which bud off the trans-Golgi network, move along cytoskeletal filaments, and fuse with the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the small GTPase Rab6 marks exocytotic vesicles and, together with the microtubule plus-end-directed motor kinesin-1, stimulates their processive microtubule-based transport to the cell periphery. Furthermore, Rab6 directs targeting of secretory vesicles to plasma-membrane sites enriched in the cortical protein ELKS, a known Rab6 binding partner. Our data demonstrate that although Rab6 is not essential for secretion, it controls the organization of exocytosis within the cellular space.",

            "abstract": "In motile fibroblasts, stable microtubules (MTs) are oriented toward the leading edge of cells. How these polarized MT arrays are established and maintained, and the cellular processes they control, have been the subject of many investigations. Several MT \"plus-end-tracking proteins,\" or +TIPs, have been proposed to regulate selective MT stabilization, including the CLASPs, a complex of CLIP-170, IQGAP1, activated Cdc42 or Rac1, a complex of APC, EB1, and mDia1, and the actin-MT crosslinking factor ACF7. By using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in a wound-healing assay, we show here that CLASP2 is required for the formation of a stable, polarized MT array but that CLIP-170 and an APC-EB1 interaction are not essential. Persistent motility is also hampered in CLASP2-deficient MEFs. We find that ACF7 regulates cortical CLASP localization in HeLa cells, indicating it acts upstream of CLASP2. Fluorescence-based approaches show that GFP-CLASP2 is immobilized in a bimodal manner in regions near cell edges. Our results suggest that the regional immobilization of CLASP2 allows MT stabilization and promotes directionally persistent motility in fibroblasts.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

Here, we develop a model system of focal adhesion disassembly based on the finding that microtubule regrowth after nocodazole washout induces disassembly of focal adhesions, and that this disassembly occurs independently of Rho and Rac, but depends on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and dynamin. During disassembly, dynamin interacts with FAK and colocalizes with focal adhesions. Inhibition of dynamin prevents migration of cells with a focal adhesion phenotype. Our results show that focal adhesion disassembly involves microtubules, dynamin and FAK, and is not simply the reversal of focal adhesion formation.",

At the skeletal neuromuscular junction, all synaptic RNAs identified to date encode synaptic components. Using microarrays, we compared RNAs in synapse-rich and -free regions of muscles, thereby identifying transcripts that are enriched near synapses and that encode soluble membrane and nuclear proteins. One gene product, LL5beta, binds to both phosphoinositides and a cytoskeletal protein, filamin, one form of which is concentrated at synaptic sites. LL5beta is itself associated with the cytoplasmic face of the postsynaptic membrane; its highest levels border regions of highest acetylcholine receptor (AChR) density, which suggests a role in \"corraling\" AChRs. Consistent with this idea, perturbing LL5beta expression in myotubes inhibits AChR aggregation. Thus, a strategy designed to identify novel synaptic components led to identification of a protein required for assembly of the postsynaptic apparatus.",

Using RNA interference in HeLa cells, we show that the two CLASPs play redundant roles in regulating the density, length distribution and stability of interphase MTs. In HeLa cells, both CLASPs concentrate on the distal MT ends in a narrow region at the cell margin. CLASPs stabilize MTs by promoting pauses and restricting MT growth and shortening episodes to this peripheral cell region. We demonstrate that the middle part of CLASPs binds directly to EB1 and to MTs. Furthermore, we show that the association of CLASP2 with the cell cortex is MT independent and relies on its COOH-terminal domain. Both EB1- and cortex-binding domains of CLASP are required to promote MT stability. We propose that CLASPs can mediate interactions between MT plus ends and the cell cortex and act as local rescue factors, possibly through forming a complex with EB1 at MT tips.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic regulation of adhesion complexes is required for cell migration and has therefore emerged as a key issue in the study of cell motility. Recent progress has been made in defining some of the molecular mechanisms by which adhesion disassembly is regulated, including the contributions of adhesion adaptor proteins and tyrosine kinases. However, little is known about the potential contribution of proteolytic mechanisms to the regulation of adhesion complex dynamics. Here, we show that proteolysis of talin by the intracellular calcium-dependent protease calpain is critical for focal adhesion disassembly. We have generated a single point mutation in talin that renders it resistant to proteolysis by calpain. Quantification of adhesion assembly and disassembly rates demonstrates that calpain-mediated talin proteolysis is a rate-limiting step during adhesion turnover. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disassembly of other adhesion components, including paxillin, vinculin and zyxin, is also dependent on the ability of calpain to cleave talin, suggesting a general role for talin proteolysis in regulating adhesion turnover. Together, these findings identify calpain-mediated proteolysis of talin as a mechanism by which adhesion dynamics are regulated.",

Here, we show that ACF7 is an essential integrator of MT-actin dynamics. In endodermal cells, ACF7 binds along microtubules but concentrates at their distal ends and at cell borders when polarized. In ACF7's absence, microtubules still bind EB1 and CLIP170, but they no longer grow along polarized actin bundles, nor do they pause and tether to actin-rich cortical sites. The consequences are less stable, long microtubules with skewed cytoplasmic trajectories and altered dynamic instability. In response to wounding, ACF7 null cultures activate polarizing signals, but fail to maintain them and coordinate migration. Rescue of these defects requires ACF7's actin and microtubule binding domains. Thus, spectraplakins are important for controlling microtubule dynamics and reinforcing links between microtubules and polarized F-actin, so that cellular polarization and coordinated cell movements can be sustained.",

The fidelity of adhesion site targeting is precise; using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we now show microtubule ends (visualized by incorporation of GFP tubulin) are within 50 nm of the substrate when polymerizing toward the cell periphery, but not when shrinking from it. Multiple microtubules sometimes followed similar tracks, suggesting guidance along a common cytoskeletal element. Use of TIRFM with GFP- or DsRed-zyxin in combination with either GFP-tubulin or GFP-CLIP-170 further revealed that the polymerizing microtubule plus ends that tracked close to the dorsal surface consistently targeted substrate adhesion complexes. This supports a central role for the microtubule tip complex in the guidance of microtubules into adhesion foci, and provides evidence for an intimate cross-talk between microtubule tips and substrate adhesions in the range of molecular dimensions.",

For most cells, polarisation requires the engagement of microtubules, which exert their effect by mediating changes in the activity of the Rho GTPases. Evidence suggests that these changes are effected in a very localised fashion at sites of substrate adhesion, via specific microtubule-targeting interactions. Targeting serves to bring molecular complexes bound at the tips and along microtubules in close proximity with adhesion complexes, to promote adhesion disassembly and remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton.",

The protein bound PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) selectively in vitro. Strikingly, a substantial proportion of LL5beta became associated with an unidentified intracellular vesicle population in the context of low PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) levels produced by the addition of wortmannin or LY294002. In addition, expression of platelet-derived growth factor-receptor mutants unable to activate type 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or serum starvation in porcine aortic endothelial cells lead to redistribution of LL5beta to this vesicle population. Importantly, pleckstrin homology domain mutants of LL5beta that could not bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) were constitutively localized to this vesicle population. At increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) levels, LL5beta was redirected to a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution, presumably through a PI3K-dependent block on its targeting to the vesicular compartment. Furthermore, at high, hormone-stimulated PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) levels, it became significantly plasma-membrane localized. The distribution of LL5beta is thus dramatically and uniquely sensitive to low levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) indicating it can act as a sensor of both low and hormone-stimulated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3). In addition, LL5beta bound to the cytoskeletal adaptor, gamma-filamin, tightly and in a PI3K-independent fashion, both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction could co-localize heterologously expressed gamma-filamin with GFP-LL5beta in the unidentified vesicles.",

            "abstract": "We recently showed that substrate contact sites in living fibroblasts are specifically targeted by microtubules (Kaverina, I., K. Rottner, and J.V. Small. 1998. J. Cell Biol. 142:181-190). Evidence is now provided that microtubule contact targeting plays a role in the modulation of substrate contact dynamics. The results are derived from spreading and polarized goldfish fibroblasts in which microtubules and contact sites were simultaneously visualized using proteins conjugated with Cy-3, rhodamine, or green fluorescent protein. For cells allowed to spread in the presence of nocodazole the turnover of contacts was retarded, as compared with controls and adhesions that were retained under the cell body were dissociated after microtubule reassembly. In polarized cells, small focal complexes were found at the protruding cell front and larger adhesions, corresponding to focal adhesions, at the retracting flanks and rear. At retracting edges, multiple microtubule contact targeting preceded contact release and cell edge retraction. The same effect could be observed in spread cells, in which microtubules were allowed to reassemble after local disassembly by the application of nocodazole to one cell edge. At the protruding front of polarized cells, focal complexes were also targeted and as a result remained either unchanged in size or, more rarely, were disassembled. Conversely, when contact targeting at the cell front was prevented by freezing microtubule growth with 20 nM taxol and protrusion stimulated by the injection of constitutively active Rac, peripheral focal complexes became abnormally enlarged. We further found that the local application of inhibitors of myosin contractility to cell edges bearing focal adhesions induced the same contact dissociation and edge retraction as observed after microtubule targeting. Our data are consistent with a mechanism whereby microtubules deliver localized doses of relaxing signals to contact sites to retard or reverse their development. We propose that it is via this route that microtubules exert their well-established control on cell polarity.",

            "abstract": "By co-injecting fluorescent tubulin and vinculin into fish fibroblasts we have revealed a \"cross talk\" between microtubules and early sites of substrate contact. This mutuality was first indicated by the targeting of vinculin-rich foci by microtubules during their growth towards the cell periphery. In addition to passing directly over contact sites, the ends of single microtubules could be observed to target several contacts in succession or the same contact repetitively, with intermittent withdrawals. Targeting sometimes involved side-stepping, or the major re-routing of a microtubule, indicative of a guided, rather than a random process. The paths that microtubules followed into contacts were unrelated to the orientation of stress fiber assemblies and targeting occurred also in mouse fibroblasts that lacked a system of intermediate filaments. Further experiments with microtubule inhibitors showed that adhesion foci can: (a) capture microtubules and stabilize them against disassembly by nocodazole; and (b), act as preferred sites of microtubule polymerization, during either early recovery from nocodazole, or brief treatment with taxol. From these and other findings we speculate that microtubules are guided into substrate contact sites and through the motor-dependent delivery of signaling molecules serve to modulate their development. It is further proposed this modulation provides the route whereby microtubules exert their influence on cell shape and polarity.",

            "abstract": "KANK proteins mediate cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix. KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Prickle is known to be involved in planar cell polarity, including convergent extension and cell migration; however, the detailed mechanism by which Prickle regulates cellular functions is not well understood. Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "The Kank (kidney or KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing) family of proteins has been described as essential for crosstalk between actin and microtubules. Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms controlling microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex play a crucial role in cell morphogenesis and neuronal development. Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs) with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for coordinated cell movement. In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "Talin protein is one of the key components in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes. Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

            "abstract": "Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration, yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear. By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

            "abstract": "Engagement of integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix induces the formation of focal adhesions (FAs). Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is essential for cellular processes, such as migration and invasion. In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Talin protein is one of the key components in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes. Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Prickle is known to be involved in planar cell polarity, including convergent extension and cell migration; however, the detailed mechanism by which Prickle regulates cellular functions is not well understood. Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

            "abstract": "Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration, yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear. By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation.

These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "KANK proteins mediate cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix. KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent cell adhesions come in different shapes and serve in different cell types for tasks ranging from cell-adhesion, migration, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix to the formation and stabilization of immunological and chemical synapses. A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor gene, which is frequently inactivated in cancer, encodes a Rho-GAP (GTPase activating protein) focal adhesion protein whose negative regulation of Rho-GTPases is necessary but not sufficient for its full tumor suppressor activity. Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is essential for cellular processes, such as migration and invasion. In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion to the extracellular matrix persists during mitosis in most cell types. However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "Talin protein is one of the key components in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes. Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "The ability of cells to form cell contacts, adhere to the extracellular matrix, change morphology, and migrate is essential for development, wound healing, metastasis, cell survival and the immune response. These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "Prickle is known to be involved in planar cell polarity, including convergent extension and cell migration; however, the detailed mechanism by which Prickle regulates cellular functions is not well understood. Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

            "abstract": "A well-controlled microtubule organization is essential for intracellular transport, cytoskeleton maintenance, and cell development. KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent cell adhesions come in different shapes and serve in different cell types for tasks ranging from cell-adhesion, migration, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix to the formation and stabilization of immunological and chemical synapses. A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "Engagement of integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix induces the formation of focal adhesions (FAs). Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) play an important role in cancer cell migration and metastasis by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, allowing the cell to generate traction. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

            "abstract": "Prickle is known to be involved in planar cell polarity, including convergent extension and cell migration; however, the detailed mechanism by which Prickle regulates cellular functions is not well understood. Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration, yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear. By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

            "abstract": "The Kank (kidney or KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing) family of proteins has been described as essential for crosstalk between actin and microtubules. Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

            "abstract": "The ability of cells to form cell contacts, adhere to the extracellular matrix, change morphology, and migrate is essential for development, wound healing, metastasis, cell survival and the immune response. These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Talin protein is one of the key components in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes. Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms controlling microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex play a crucial role in cell morphogenesis and neuronal development. Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is essential for cellular processes, such as migration and invasion. In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

            "abstract": "Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration, yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear. By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

            "abstract": "The ability of cells to form cell contacts, adhere to the extracellular matrix, change morphology, and migrate is essential for development, wound healing, metastasis, cell survival and the immune response. These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration, yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear. By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion to the extracellular matrix persists during mitosis in most cell types. However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates class I ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) by accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "Turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs) with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for coordinated cell movement. In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Engagement of integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix induces the formation of focal adhesions (FAs). Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is essential for cellular processes, such as migration and invasion. In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Engagement of integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix induces the formation of focal adhesions (FAs). Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

            "abstract": "In cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions), the cytoskeletal protein talin is central to the connection of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms controlling microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex play a crucial role in cell morphogenesis and neuronal development. Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is essential for cellular processes, such as migration and invasion. In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "Talin protein is one of the key components in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes. Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms controlling microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex play a crucial role in cell morphogenesis and neuronal development. Here, we identified kinesin-4 KIF21A as an inhibitor of microtubule growth at the cell cortex. In vitro, KIF21A suppresses microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. In cells, KIF21A restricts microtubule growth and participates in organizing microtubule arrays at the cell edge. KIF21A is recruited to the cortex by KANK1, which coclusters with liprin-α1/β1 and the components of the LL5β-containing cortical microtubule attachment complexes. Mutations in KIF21A have been linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), a dominant disorder associated with neurodevelopmental defects. CFEOM1-associated mutations relieve autoinhibition of the KIF21A motor, and this results in enhanced KIF21A accumulation in axonal growth cones, aberrant axon morphology, and reduced responsiveness to inhibitory cues. Our study provides mechanistic insight into cortical microtubule regulation and suggests that altered microtubule dynamics contribute to CFEOM1 pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Adhesion complex formation and disassembly is crucial for maintaining efficient cell movement. During migration, several proteins act in concert to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and we have previously shown that in highly invasive breast cancer cells, this process is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. These are overexpressed and highly activated in these cells. Here, we report that one mechanism by which ARF1 regulates migration is by controlling assembly of focal adhesions. In cells depleted of ARF1, paxillin is no longer colocalized with actin at focal adhesion sites. In addition, we demonstrate that this occurs through the ability of ARF1 to regulate the recruitment of key proteins such as paxillin, talin and FAK to ß1-integrin. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between paxillin and talin together and with FAK are significantly impaired in ARF1 knocked down cells. Our findings also indicate that ARF1 is essential for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of FAK and Src. Finally, we report that ARF1 can be found in complex with key focal adhesion proteins such as ß1-integrin, paxillin, talin and FAK. Together our findings uncover a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and provide this GTPase as a target for the development of new therapeutics in triple negative breast cancer. ",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we find that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11. Unexpectedly, endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes. FAK and Src kinases co-localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling, respectively. FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ)-dependent manner. In migrating cells, endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge, and this polarization required FAK. These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation. We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration.",

Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle-capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.",

            "abstract": "Turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs) with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for coordinated cell movement. In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.

            "abstract": "Many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood, but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post-entry processes. Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

Talins transmit mechanical forces between β-integrin and actin, and regulate adhesion complex composition and signaling through the force-regulated unfolding of talin rod domain. Using modified talin proteins, we demonstrate that these functions contribute to different cellular processes and can be dissected. The transmission of mechanical forces regulates adhesion complex composition and phosphotyrosine signaling even in the absence of the mechanically regulated talin rod subdomains. However, the presence of the rod subdomains and their mechanical activation are required for the reinforcement of the adhesion complex, cell polarization and migration. Talin rod domain unfolding was also found to be essential for the generation of cellular signaling anisotropy, since both insufficient and excess activity of the rod domain severely inhibited cell polarization. Utilizing proteomics tools, we identified adhesome components that are recruited and activated either in a talin rod-dependent manner or independently of the rod subdomains. This study clarifies the division of roles between the force-regulated unfolding of a talin protein (talin 1) and its function as a physical linker between integrins and the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Prickle is known to be involved in planar cell polarity, including convergent extension and cell migration; however, the detailed mechanism by which Prickle regulates cellular functions is not well understood. Here, we show that Prickle1 regulates front-rear polarization and migration of gastric cancer MKN1 cells. Prickle1 preferentially accumulated at the cell retraction site in close proximity to paxillin at focal adhesions. Prickle1 dynamics correlated with those of paxillin during focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, Prickle1 was required for focal adhesion disassembly. CLASPs (of which there are two isoforms, CLASP1 and CLASP2, in mammals) and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2) have been reported to form a complex at cell edges and to control microtubule-dependent focal adhesion disassembly. Prickle1 was associated with CLASPs and LL5β, and was required for the LL5β-dependent accumulation of CLASPs at the cell edge. Knockdown of CLASPs and LL5β suppressed Prickle1-dependent cell polarization and migration. Prickle1 localized to the membrane through its farnesyl moiety, and the membrane localization was necessary for Prickle1 to regulate migration, to bind to CLASPs and LL5β, and to promote microtubule targeting of focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that Prickle1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly during the retraction processes of cell polarization and migration.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) play an important role in cancer cell migration and metastasis by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, allowing the cell to generate traction. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

A major challenge consists in the identification of adhesion-specific as well as common regulatory mechanisms, motivating the need for a deeper analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of intact focal adhesions. Specifically, it is critical to understand how small differences in binding of integrins to extracellular ligands and/or cytoplasmic adapter proteins affect the assembly and function of an entire focal adhesion. By using the talin-integrin pair as a starting point, I would like to discuss how specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions can control the behavior and function of focal adhesions. By responding to chemical and mechanical cues several allosterically regulated proteins create a dynamic multifunctional protein network that provides both adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as intracellular signaling in response to mechanical changes in the cellular environment.",

Kank1, 2, 3 and 4 arose by gene duplication and diversification and share conserved structural domains. KANK proteins are localised mainly to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions, indirectly affecting RhoA and Rac1 thus regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Kank proteins are part of the cortical microtubule stabilisation complex regulating microtubules. Most of the data have been collected for Kank1 protein whose expression promotes apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest while Kank3 was identified as hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic target of p53. A discrepancy in Kanks role in regulation of cell migration and sensitivity to antitumour drugs has been observed in different cell models. Since expression of Kank1 and 3 correlate positively with tumour progression and patient outcome, at least in some tumour types, they are candidates for tumour suppressors.",

In response to cues from the microenvironment, integrin-mediated adhesions alter cellular behaviour through cytoskeletal rearrangements. The tight association of the actin cytoskeleton with adhesive structures has been extensively studied, whereas the microtubule network in this context has gathered far less attention. In recent years, however, microtubules have emerged as key regulators of cell adhesion and migration through their participation in adhesion turnover and cellular signalling. In this Review, we focus on the interactions between microtubules and integrin-mediated adhesions, in particular, focal adhesions and podosomes. Starting with the association of microtubules with these adhesive structures, we describe the classical role of microtubules in vesicular trafficking, which is involved in the turnover of cell adhesions, before discussing how microtubules can also influence the actin-focal adhesion interplay through RhoGTPase signalling, thereby orchestrating a very crucial crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks and adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Kidney ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (KANK1/2/3/4) belong to a family of scaffold proteins, playing critical roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and migration. Mutations in KANK proteins are implicated in cancers and genetic diseases, such as nephrotic syndrome. KANK proteins can bind various target proteins through different protein regions, including a highly conserved ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). However, the molecular basis for target recognition by the ANKRD remains elusive. In this study, we solved a high-resolution crystal structure of the ANKRD of KANK1 in complex with a short sequence of the motor protein kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), revealing that the highly specific target-binding mode of the ANKRD involves combinatorial use of two interfaces. Mutations in either interface disrupted the KANK1-KIF21A interaction. Cellular immunofluorescence localization analysis indicated that binding-deficient mutations block recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions by KANK1. In conclusion, our structural study provides mechanistic explanations for the ANKRD-mediated recognition of KIF21A and for many disease-related mutations identified in human KANK proteins.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites. The binding sites are cryptic in the head-to-rod autoinhibited cytoplasmic form of the protein and require (stepwise) conformational activation. This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization. Here, we report turnover rates and protein-protein interactions in a range of talin rod domain constructs varying in helix bundle structure. We conclude that several bundles of the C terminus cooperate to regulate targeting and concomitantly tailor high affinity interactions of the talin rod in cell adhesions. Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin.",

            "abstract": "The ability of cells to form cell contacts, adhere to the extracellular matrix, change morphology, and migrate is essential for development, wound healing, metastasis, cell survival and the immune response. These events depend on the binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix, and assembly of focal adhesions, which are complexes comprising scaffolding and signalling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) regulates interactions between these proteins, including the interaction of vinculin with actin and talin. The binding of talin to beta-integrin is strengthened by PtdIns(4,5)P(2), suggesting that the basis of focal adhesion assembly is regulated by this lipid mediator. Here we show that the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoform-gamma 661 (PIPKI gamma 661), an enzyme that makes PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is targeted to focal adhesions by an association with talin. PIPKI gamma 661 is tyrosine phosphorylated by focal adhesion associated kinase signalling, increasing both the activity of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and its association with talin. This defines a mechanism for spatial generation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at focal adhesions.",

Among proteins that interact with BIG1, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein, moves cargo away from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) on microtubules. Because KANK1, a protein containing N-terminal KN, C-terminal ankyrin-repeat, and intervening coiled-coil domains, has multiple actions in cells and also interacts with KIF21A, we explored a possible interaction between it and BIG1. We obtained evidence for a functional and physical association between these proteins, and found that the effects of BIG1 and KANK1 depletion on cell migration in wound-healing assays were remarkably similar. Treatment of cells with BIG1- or KANK1-specific siRNA interfered significantly with directed cell migration and initial orientation of Golgi/MTOC toward the leading edge, which was not mimicked by KIF21A depletion. Although colocalization of overexpressed KANK1 and endogenous BIG1 in HeLa cells was not clear microscopically, their reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) is compatible with the presence of small percentages of each protein in the same complexes. Depletion or overexpression of BIG1 protein appeared not to affect KANK1 distribution. Our data identify actions of both BIG1 and KANK1 in regulating cell polarity during directed migration; these actions are consistent with the presence of both BIG1 and KANK1 in dynamic multimolecular complexes that maintain Golgi/MTOC orientation, differ from those that might contain all three proteins (BIG1, KIF21A, and KANK1), and function in directed transport along microtubules.",

Using mass spectrometry-based assays, we have identified two CLASP partners, LL5beta and ELKS. LL5beta and ELKS form a complex that colocalizes with CLASPs at the cortex of HeLa cells as well as at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. LL5beta is required for cortical CLASP accumulation and microtubule stabilization in HeLa cells, while ELKS plays an accessory role in these processes. LL5beta is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and its recruitment to the cell cortex is influenced by PI3 kinase activity but does not require intact microtubules. Cortical clusters of LL5beta and ELKS do not overlap with focal adhesions but often form in their vicinity and can affect their size. We propose that LL5beta and ELKS can form a PIP3-regulated cortical platform to which CLASPs attach distal microtubule ends.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. RESULTS: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2. CONCLUSION: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds β-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of αIIbβ3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

            "abstract": "Engagement of integrin receptors with the extracellular matrix induces the formation of focal adhesions (FAs). Dynamic regulation of FAs is necessary for cells to polarize and migrate. Key interactions between FA scaffolding and signaling proteins are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the precise role of tyrosine phosphorylation in FA development and maturation is poorly defined. Here, we show that phosphorylation of type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma661) on tyrosine 644 (Y644) is critical for its interaction with talin, and consequently, localization to FAs. PIPKIgamma661 is specifically phosphorylated on Y644 by Src. Phosphorylation is regulated by focal adhesion kinase, which enhances the association between PIPKIgamma661 and Src. The phosphorylation of Y644 results in an approximately 15-fold increase in binding affinity to the talin head domain and blocks beta-integrin binding to talin. This defines a novel phosphotyrosine-binding site on the talin F3 domain and a \"molecular switch\" for talin binding between PIPKIgamma661 and beta-integrin that may regulate dynamic FA turnover.",

            "abstract": "A well-controlled microtubule organization is essential for intracellular transport, cytoskeleton maintenance, and cell development. KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1), a member of KANK family, recruits kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) to the cell cortex to control microtubule growth via its C-terminal ankyrin domain. However, how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK proteins can also bind KIF21A remain unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we found that a stretch of ∼22 amino acids in KIF21A is sufficient for binding to KANK1 and its close homolog KANK2. We further solved the complex structure of the KIF21A peptide with either the KANK1 ankyrin domain or the KANK2 ankyrin domain. In each complex, KIF21A is recognized by two distinct pockets of the ankyrin domain and adopts helical conformations upon binding to the ankyrin domain. The elucidated KANK structures may advance our understanding of the role of KANK1 as a scaffolding molecule in controlling microtubule growth at the cell periphery.",
