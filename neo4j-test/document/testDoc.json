            "Abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) is an atypical MAPK. Its function in regulating cancer growth remains elusive. Here, we reported that MAPK6 directly activated AKT and induced oncogenic outcomes. MAPK6 interacted with AKT through its C34 region and the C-terminal tail and phosphorylated AKT at S473 independent of mTORC2, the major S473 kinase. mTOR kinase inhibitors have not made notable progress in the clinic. Our identified MAPK6-AKT axis may provide a major resistance pathway. Besides repressing growth, inhibiting MAPK6 sensitized cancer cells to mTOR kinase inhibitors. MAPK6 overexpression is associated with decreased overall survival and the survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and breast cancer. MAPK6 expression also correlated with AKT phosphorylation at S473 in human cancer tissues. We conclude that MAPK6 can promote cancer by activating AKT independent of mTORC2 and targeting MAPK6, either alone or in combination with mTOR blockade, may be effective in cancers.",

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for PCa cell growth/survival and remains a key therapeutic target for lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). GATA2 is a pioneer transcription factor crucial for inducing AR expression/activation. We recently reported that MAPK4, an atypical MAPK, promotes tumor progression via noncanonical activation of AKT. Here, we demonstrated that MAPK4 activated AR by enhancing GATA2 transcriptional expression and stabilizing GATA2 protein through repression of GATA2 ubiquitination/degradation. MAPK4 expression correlated with AR activation in human CRPC. Concerted activation of both GATA2/AR and AKT by MAPK4 promoted PCa cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, xenograft growth, and castration resistance. Conversely, knockdown of MAPK4 decreased activation of both AR and AKT and inhibited PCa cell and xenograft growth, including castration-resistant growth. Both GATA2/AR and AKT activation were necessary for MAPK4 tumor-promoting activity. Interestingly, combined overexpression of GATA2 plus a constitutively activated AKT was sufficient to drive PCa growth and castration resistance, shedding light on an alternative, MAPK4-independent tumor-promoting pathway in human PCa. We concluded that MAPK4 promotes PCa growth and castration resistance by cooperating parallel pathways of activating GATA2/AR and AKT and that MAPK4 is a novel therapeutic target in PCa, especially CRPC.",

            "abstract": "ERK3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the physiological significance of its short half-life remains unclear. By employing gastrointestinal 3D organoids, we detect that ERK3 protein levels steadily decrease during epithelial differentiation. ERK3 is not required for 3D growth of human gastric epithelium. However, ERK3 is stabilized and activated in tumorigenic cells, but deteriorates over time in primary cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ERK3 is necessary for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumorigenic cells. Particularly, ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein. The secretome of ERK3-deficient cells is defective in chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Further, knockdown of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We unveil an ERK3-mediated regulation of IL-8 and epithelial secretome for chemotaxis.",

Exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying cervical cancer pathogenesis will provide new insights into the development of novel therapies. In this study, we were aimed to characterize a novel miRNA in cervical cancer tumorigenesis. First, we measured the expressional change of miR-144-3p in clinical tissues and cancer cells. Second, we employed cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion assays to understand its functional role in cervical cancer. Then, we confirmed in vitro findings in xenograft cancer model. Last, we mapped out a downstream target of miR-144-3p and validated its functional role in cancer cells. In the results, miR-144-3p was found significantly downregulated in cervical cancer cells and tissues. Over-expressing miR-144-3p suppressed cancer cells growth and metastasis. Consistent with in vitro results, over-expressing miR-144-3p led to tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Further on, MAPK6 was identified as an endogenous target of miR-144-3p in cervical cancer. Knocking down MAPK6 inhibited cervical cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion potential. Our investigation was the first time to report miR-144-3p as a tumor suppressive miRNA in cervical cancer. It inhibited tumor growth by targeting MAKP6. The newly identified signalling axis may serve as novel therapeutic targets to manage cervical cancer.",

            "abstract": "MAPK4 is an atypical MAPK. Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.",

            "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) represents an atypical MAPK also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), which has been shown to play roles in cell motility and metastasis. ERK3 promotes migration and invasion of lung cancer cells and head and neck cancer cells by regulating the expression and/or activity of proteins involved in cancer progression. For instance, ERK3 upregulates matrix metallopeptidases and thereby promotes cancer cell invasiveness, and it phosphorylates tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2, thereby enhancing chemoresistance in lung cancer. Here we discovered that ERK3 plays a converse role in melanoma. We observed that BRAF, an oncogenic Ser/Thr kinase, upregulates ERK3 expression levels by increasing both ERK3 messenger RNA levels and protein stability. Interestingly, although BRAF's kinase activity was required for upregulating ERK3 gene transcription, BRAF stabilized ERK3 protein in a kinase-independent fashion. We further demonstrate that ERK3 inhibits the migration, proliferation and colony formation of melanoma cells. In line with this, high level of ERK3 predicted increased survival among patients with melanomas. Taken together, these results indicate that ERK3 acts as a potent suppressor of melanoma cell growth and invasiveness.",

The aim of this study was to determine the role of miR-26a in the development of neointimal hyperplasia of autogenous vein grafts. Using autologous jugular vein grafts in the rat carotid artery as a model, we found that miR-26a was significantly downregulated in grafted veins as well as proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Overexpression of miR-26a reduced the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Further analysis revealed that the effects of miR-26a in VSMCs were mediated by targeting MAPK6 at the mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase assays showed that miR-26a repressed wild type (WT) MAPK6-3'-UTR-luciferase activity but not mutant MAPK6-3'-UTR-luciferease reporter. MAPK6 deficiency reduced proliferation and migration; in contrast, overexpression of MAPK6 enhanced the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. This study confirmed that neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts was reduced in vivo by up-regulated miR-26a expression. In conclusion, our results showed that miR-26a is an important regulator of VSMC functions and neointimal hyperplasia, suggesting that miR-26a may be a potential therapeutic target for autologous vein graft diseases.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is commonly used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but does not benefit patients with solid tumors. When combined with other agents or radiation, ATO showed treatment benefits with manageable toxicity. Previously, we reported that metformin amplified the inhibitory effect of ATO on intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cells more significantly than other agents. Here, we investigated the chemotherapeutic sensitization effect of metformin in ATO-based treatment in ICC in vitro and in vivo and explored the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: ICC cell lines (CCLP-1, RBE, and HCCC-9810) were treated with metformin and/or ATO; the anti-proliferation effect was evaluated by cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and intracellular-reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. The in vivo efficacy was determined in nude mice with CCLP-1 xenografts. The active status of AMPK/p38 MAPK and mTORC1 pathways was detected by western blot. In addition, an antibody array was used screening more than 200 molecules clustered in 12 cancer-related pathways in CCLP-1 cells treated with metformin and/or ATO. Methods of genetic modulation and pharmacology were further used to demonstrate the relationship of the molecule. Seventy-three tumor samples from ICC patients were used to detect the expression of ERK3 by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between ERK3 and the clinical information of ICC patients were further analyzed. RESULTS: Metformin and ATO synergistically inhibited proliferation of ICC cells by promoting cell apoptosis, inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and increasing intracellular ROS. Combined treatment with metformin and ATO efficiently reduced ICC growth in an ICC xenograft model. Mechanistically, the antibody array revealed that ERK3 exhibited the highest variation in CCLP-1 cells after treatment with metformin and ATO. Results of western blot confirm that metformin and ATO cooperated to inhibit mTORC1, activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and upregulate ERK3. Metformin abrogated the activation of p38 MAPK induced by ATO, and this activity was partially dependent on AMPK activation. Inactivation of p38 MAPK by SB203580 or specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted the inactivation of mTORC1 in ICC cells treated with metformin and ATO. Activation of p38 MAPK may be responsible for resistance to ATO in ICC. The relationship between p38 MAPK and ERK3 was not defined by our findings. Finally, AMPK is a newfound positive regulator of ERK3. Overexpression of EKR3 in ICC cells inhibited cell proliferation through inactivation of mTORC1. ERK3 expression is associated with a better prognosis in ICC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin sensitizes arsenic trioxide to suppress intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via the regulation of AMPK/p38 MAPK-ERK3/mTORC1 pathways. ERK3 is a newfound potential prognostic predictor and a tumor suppressor in ICC.",

Recent studies have revealed that ERK3 is upregulated in multiple cancers and promotes cancer cell migration/invasion and drug resistance. Little is known, however, about how ERK3 expression level is upregulated in cancers. Here, we have identified the oncogenic polycomb group protein BMI1 as a positive regulator of ERK3 level in head and neck cancer cells. Mechanistically, BMI1 upregulates ERK3 expression by suppressing the tumor suppressive microRNA (miRNA) let-7i, which directly targets ERK3 mRNA. ERK3 then acts as an important downstream mediator of BMI1 in promoting cancer cell migration. Importantly, ERK3 protein level is positively correlated with BMI1 level in head and neck tumor specimens of human patients. Taken together, our study revealed a molecular pathway consisting of BMI1, miRNA let-7i, and ERK3, which controls the migration of head and neck cancer cells, and suggests that ERK3 kinase is a potential new therapeutic target in head and neck cancers, particularly those with BMI1 overexpression.",

The regulation of TDP2 activity by post-translational modifications in DNA repair, however, remains unclear. In the current study, we have found that ERK3, an atypical MAPK, phosphorylates TDP2 at S60 and regulates TDP2's phosphodiesterase activity, thereby cooperatively protecting lung cancer cells against Top2 inhibitors-induced DNA damage and growth inhibition. As such, our study revealed a post-translational regulation of TDP2 activity and discovered a new role of ERK3 in increasing cancer cells' DNA damage response and chemoresistance to Top2 inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "ERK3 is an atypical Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK6). Despite the fact that the Erk3 gene was originally identified in 1991, its function is still unknown. MK5 (MAP kinase- activated protein kinase 5) also called PRAK is the only known substrate for ERK3. Recently, it was found that group I p21 protein activated kinases (PAKs) are critical effectors of ERK3. PAKs link Rho family of GTPases to actin cytoskeletal dynamics and are known to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. In this study we demonstrate that ERK3 protein levels are elevated as MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells adhere to collagen I which is concomitant with changes in cellular morphology where cells become less well spread following nascent adhesion formation. During this early cellular adhesion event we observe that the cells retain protrusive activity while reducing overall cellular area. Interestingly exogenous expression of ERK3 delivers a comparable reduction in cell spread area, while depletion of ERK3 expression increases cell spread area. Importantly, we have detected a novel specific endogenous ERK3 localization at the cell periphery. Furthermore we find that ERK3 overexpressing cells exhibit a rounded morphology and increased cell migration speed. Surprisingly, exogenous expression of a kinase inactive mutant of ERK3 phenocopies ERK3 overexpression, suggesting a novel kinase independent function for ERK3. Taken together our data suggest that as cells initiate adhesion to matrix increasing levels of ERK3 at the cell periphery are required to orchestrate cell morphology changes which can then drive migratory behavior.",

While it is shown that disruption of ERK3 gene causes neonatal lethality, cell type-specific functions of ERK3 signaling remain to be explored. In this study, we report that ERK3 gene expression is upregulated by cytokines through c-Jun in endothelial cells; c-Jun binds to the ERK3 gene and regulates its transcription. We further reveal a new role for ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation by upregulating SRC-3/SP-1-mediated VEGFR2 expression. The underlying molecular mechanism involves ERK3-stimulated formation of a transcriptional complex involving coactivator SRC-3, transcription factor SP-1 and the secondary coactivator CBP. Taken together, our study identified a molecular regulatory mechanism of ERK3 gene expression and revealed a previously unknown role of ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell functions.",

Here, we report that ERK3 interacted with and phosphorylated steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), an oncogenic protein overexpressed in multiple human cancers at serine 857 (S857). This ERK3-mediated phosphorylation at S857 was essential for interaction of SRC-3 with the ETS transcription factor PEA3, which promotes upregulation of MMP gene expression and proinvasive activity in lung cancer cells. Importantly, knockdown of ERK3 or SRC-3 inhibited the ability of lung cancer cells to invade and form tumors in the lung in a xenograft mouse model. In addition, ERK3 was found to be highly upregulated in human lung carcinomas. Our study identifies a previously unknown role for ERK3 in promoting lung cancer cell invasiveness by phosphorylating SRC-3 and regulating SRC-3 proinvasive activity by site-specific phosphorylation. As such, ERK3 protein kinase may be an attractive target for therapeutic treatment of invasive lung cancer.",

However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Using ribosome profiling, we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the 'cancerous' translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviours, including metastasis, and may be therapeutically targeted.",

To identify pathways supporting the Myc oncogenic program, we used a genome-wide RNA interference screen to search for Myc-synthetic lethal genes and uncovered a role for the SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE1/2). Loss of SAE1/2 enzymatic activity drives synthetic lethality with Myc. Inactivation of SAE2 leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death upon Myc hyperactivation. Mechanistically, SAE2 inhibition switches a transcriptional subprogram of Myc from activated to repressed. A subset of these SUMOylation-dependent Myc switchers (SMS genes) is required for mitotic spindle function and to support the Myc oncogenic program. SAE2 is required for growth of Myc-dependent tumors in mice, and gene expression analyses of Myc-high human breast cancers suggest that low SAE1 and SAE2 abundance in the tumors correlates with longer metastasis-free survival of the patients. Thus, inhibition of SUMOylation may merit investigation as a possible therapy for Myc-driven human cancers.",

            "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate diverse cellular programs by relaying extracellular signals to intracellular responses. In mammals, there are more than a dozen MAPK enzymes that coordinately regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. The best known are the conventional MAPKs, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases 1 to 3 (JNK1 to -3), p38 (α, β, γ, and δ), and ERK5 families. There are additional, atypical MAPK enzymes, including ERK3/4, ERK7/8, and Nemo-like kinase (NLK), which have distinct regulation and functions. Together, the MAPKs regulate a large number of substrates, including members of a family of protein Ser/Thr kinases termed MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs). The MAPKAPKs are related enzymes that respond to extracellular stimulation through direct MAPK-dependent activation loop phosphorylation and kinase activation. There are five MAPKAPK subfamilies: the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK), the MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK), the MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3), and MK5 (also known as p38-regulated/activated protein kinase [PRAK]). These enzymes have diverse biological functions, including regulation of nucleosome and gene expression, mRNA stability and translation, and cell proliferation and survival. Here we review the mechanisms of MAPKAPK activation by the different MAPKs and discuss their physiological roles based on established substrates and recent discoveries.",

Although many Pak substrates, including elements of MAPK signaling cascades, have been identified, it is likely that additional substrates remain to be discovered. Identification of such substrates, and determination of the consequences of their phosphorylation, is essential for a better understanding of class I Pak activity. To identify novel class I Pak substrates, we used recombinant Pak2 to screen high density protein microarrays. This approach identified the atypical MAPK Erk3 as a potential Pak2 substrate. Solution-based in vitro kinase assays using recombinant Erk3 confirmed the protein microarray results, and phospho-specific antisera identified serine 189, within the Erk3 activation loop, as a site directly phosphorylated by Pak2 in vitro. Erk3 protein is known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and we showed that selective inhibition of class I Pak kinase activity in cells promoted increased nuclear accumulation of Erk3. Pak inhibition in cells additionally reduced the extent of Ser(189) phosphorylation and inhibited the formation of Erk3-Prak complexes. Collectively, our results identify the Erk3 protein as a novel class I Pak substrate and further suggest a role for Pak kinase activity in atypical MAPK signaling.",

            "abstract": "Classical mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of the Thr-Xxx-Tyr motif in their activation loop, which is catalyzed by members of the MAP kinase kinase family. The atypical MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) and ERK4 contain a single phospho-acceptor site in this segment and are not substrates of MAP kinase kinases. Previous studies have shown that ERK3 and ERK4 are phosphorylated on activation loop residue Ser-189/Ser-186, resulting in their catalytic activation. However, the identity of the protein kinase mediating this regulatory event has remained elusive. We have used an unbiased biochemical purification approach to isolate the kinase activity responsible for ERK3 Ser-189 phosphorylation. Here, we report the identification of group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs) as ERK3/ERK4 activation loop kinases. We show that group I PAKs phosphorylate ERK3 and ERK4 on Ser-189 and Ser-186, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo, and that expression of activated Rac1 augments this response. Reciprocally, silencing of PAK1/2/3 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) completely abolishes Rac1-induced Ser-189 phosphorylation of ERK3. Importantly, we demonstrate that PAK-mediated phosphorylation of ERK3/ERK4 results in their enzymatic activation and in downstream activation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) in vivo. Our results reveal that group I PAKs act as upstream activators of ERK3 and ERK4 and unravel a novel PAK-ERK3/ERK4-MK5 signaling pathway.",

            "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.",

In stromal tissues, TGF-beta regulates cell proliferation, phenotype and matrix synthesis. To address mechanisms of TGF-beta action in cancer-associated reactive stroma, we developed prostate stromal cells null for TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII) or engineered to express a dominant-negative Smad3 to attenuate TGF-beta signaling. The differential reactive stroma (DRS) xenograft model was used to evaluate altered stromal TGF-beta signaling on LNCaP tumor progression. LNCaP xenograft tumors constructed with TbetaRII null or dominant-negative Smad3 stromal cells exhibited a significant reduction in mass and microvessel density relative to controls. Additionally, decreased cellular fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) immunostaining was associated with attenuated TGF-beta signaling in stroma. In vitro, TGF-beta stimulated stromal FGF-2 expression and release. However, stromal cells with attenuated TGF-beta signaling were refractory to TGF-beta-stimulated FGF-2 expression and release. Re-expression of FGF-2 in these stromal cells in DRS xenografts resulted in restored tumor mass and microvessel density. In summary, these data show that TGF-beta signaling in reactive stroma is angiogenic and tumor promoting and that this effect is mediated in part through a TbetaRII/Smad3-dependent upregulation of FGF-2 expression and release.",

In mammals, there are more than a dozen MAPK genes. The best known are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK(1-3)) and p38(alpha, beta, gamma and delta) families. ERK3, ERK5 and ERK7 are other MAPKs that have distinct regulation and functions. MAPK cascades consist of a core of three protein kinases. Despite the apparently simple architecture of this pathway, these enzymes are capable of responding to a bewildering number of stimuli to produce exquisitely specific cellular outcomes. These responses depend on the kinetics of their activation and inactivation, the subcellular localization of the kinases, the complexes in which they act, and the availability of substrates. Fine-tuning of cascade activity can occur through modulatory inputs to cascade component from the primary kinases to the scaffolding accessory proteins. Here, we describe some of the properties of the three major MAPK pathways and discuss how these properties govern pathway regulation and activity.",

Fourteen MAP kinase genes have been identified in the human genome, which define 7 distinct MAP kinase signaling pathways. MAP kinases can be classified into conventional or atypical enzymes, based on their ability to get phosphorylated and activated by members of the MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK)/MEK family. Conventional MAP kinases comprise ERK1/ERK2, p38s, JNKs, and ERK5, which are all substrates of MAPKKs. Atypical MAP kinases include ERK3/ERK4, NLK and ERK7. Much less is known about the regulation, substrate specificity and physiological functions of atypical MAP kinases.",

ERK3 is known as an unstable mostly cytoplasmic protein that binds, translocates, and activates the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 5. Here we have investigated the stability and expression of ERK4 and have analyzed its ability to bind, translocate, and activate MK5. We show that, in contrast to ERK3, ERK4 is a stable protein that binds to endogenous MK5. Interaction of ERK4 with MK5 leads to translocation of MK5 to the cytoplasm and to its activation by phosphorylation. In transfected HEK293 cells, where overexpressed catalytically dead ERK3 is able to activate MK5, catalytic activity of ERK4 is necessary for activation of MK5, indicating that ERK4 directly phosphorylates MK5. Interestingly, ERK4 dimerizes and/or oligomerizes with ERK3, suggesting that overexpressed inactive ERK3 recruits active endogenous ERK4 to MK5 for its activation. Hence, ERK3 and ERK4 cooperate in activation of MK5.",

To explore this possibility further in a mammalian model system, we disrupted the expression of rictor, a specific component of mTORC2, in mice by using a multiallelic gene targeting strategy. Embryos that lack rictor develop normally until E9.5, and then exhibit growth arrest and die by E11.5. Although placental defects occur in null embryos, an epiblast-specific knockout of rictor only delayed lethality by a few days, thereby suggesting other important roles for this complex in the embryo proper. Analyses of rictor null embryos and fibroblasts indicate that mTORC2 is a primary kinase for Ser473 of Akt/PKB. Rictor null fibroblasts exhibit low proliferation rates, impaired Akt/PKB activity, and diminished metabolic activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that both rictor and mTORC2 are essential for the development of both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues.",

Akt/PKB activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Ser473 within the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif by an unknown kinase. We show that in Drosophila and human cells the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase and its associated protein rictor are necessary for Ser473 phosphorylation and that a reduction in rictor or mammalian TOR (mTOR) expression inhibited an Akt/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on Ser473 in vitro and facilitated Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1. Rictor-mTOR may serve as a drug target in tumors that have lost the expression of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that opposes Akt/PKB activation.",

However, its function is unknown and no physiological substrates for ERK3 have yet been identified. Here we demonstrate a specific interaction between ERK3 and MAPK-activated protein kinase-5 (MK5). Binding results in nuclear exclusion of both ERK3 and MK5 and is accompanied by ERK3-dependent phosphorylation and activation of MK5 in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous MK5 activity is significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERK3 and also in fibroblasts derived from ERK3-/- mice. Furthermore, increased levels of ERK3 protein detected during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PC12 cells are accompanied by an increase in MK5 activity. Conversely, MK5 depletion causes a dramatic reduction in endogenous ERK3 levels. Our data identify the first physiological protein substrate for ERK3 and suggest a functional link between these kinases in which MK5 is a downstream target of ERK3, while MK5 acts as a chaperone for ERK3. Our findings provide valuable tools to further dissect the regulation and biological roles of both ERK3 and MK5.",

Here we show that ERK3 specifically interacts with the MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5 or PRAK) in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ERK3 in mammalian cells leads to nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation and activation of MK5 and to phosphorylation of both ERK3 and MK5. Remarkably, activation of MK5 is independent of ERK3 enzymatic activity, but depends on its own catalytic activity as well as on a region in the C-terminal extension of ERK3. In mouse embryonic development, mRNA expression patterns of ERK3 and MK5 suggest spatiotemporal coexpression of both kinases. Deletion of MK5 leads to strong reduction of ERK3 protein levels and embryonic lethality at about stage E11, where ERK3 expression in wild-type mice is maximum, indicating a role of this signalling module in development.",

Little is known on the regulation of ERK3 function. Here, we report that ERK3 is constitutively localized in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. In contrast to other mitogen-activated protein kinases, the cellular distribution of ERK3 remains unchanged in response to common mitogenic or stress stimuli and is independent of the enzymatic activity or phosphorylation of the kinase. The cytoplasmic localization of ERK3 is directed by a CRM1-dependent nuclear export mechanism. Treatment of cells with leptomycin B causes the nuclear accumulation of ERK3 in a high percentage of cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of CRM1 promotes the cytoplasmic relocalization of ERK3, whereas overexpression of snurportin 1, which binds CRM1 with high affinity, inhibits the nuclear export of ERK3. We also show that CRM1 binds to ERK3 in vitro. Importantly, we show that enforced localization of ERK3 in the nucleus or cytoplasm markedly attenuates the ability of the kinase to induce cell cycle arrest in fibroblasts. Our results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ERK3 is required for its negative regulatory effect on cell cycle progression.",

Here we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), unlike other MAP kinases, is an unstable protein that is constitutively degraded in proliferating cells with a half-life of 30 min. The proteolysis of ERK3 is executed by the proteasome and requires ubiquitination of the protein. Contrary to other protein kinases, the catalytic activity of ERK3 is not responsible for its short half-life. Instead, analysis of ERK1/ERK3 chimeras revealed the presence of two destabilization regions (NDR1 and -2) in the N-terminal lobe of the ERK3 kinase domain that are both necessary and sufficient to target ERK3 and heterologous proteins for proteasomal degradation. To assess the physiological relevance of the rapid turnover of ERK3, we monitored the expression of the kinase in different cellular models of differentiation. We observed that ERK3 markedly accumulates during differentiation of PC12 and C2C12 cells into the neuronal and muscle lineage, respectively. The accumulation of ERK3 during myogenic differentiation is associated with the time-dependent stabilization of the protein. Terminal skeletal muscle differentiation is accompanied by cell cycle withdrawal. Interestingly, we found that expression of stabilized forms of ERK3 causes G(1) arrest in NIH 3T3 cells. We propose that ERK3 biological activity is regulated by its cellular abundance through the control of protein stability.",

ChK also has been shown to downregulate two important kinases involved in oncogenic pathways, Akt and JNK. This report investigates how ChK is involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (RTK/PI3K/mTORC2/Akt) to the centrally located protein kinase, Akt. Studies have reported that ChK does not inhibit PI3K comparable to wortmannin and does not affect PDK1 activation. PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylation on Akt T308, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt S473. Yet, Akt's two activation sites, T308 and S473, are known to be affected by ChK treatment. It was our hypothesis that ChK acts on the mTORC2 complex to inhibit the phosphorylation seen at Akt S473. This inhibition at mTORC2 should decrease phosphorylation at both these proteins, Akt and mTORC2 complex, compared to a known mTOR specific inhibitor, Torin1. Human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and H2009 cells were treated with IGF-1 or calyculin A to increase phosphorylation at complex mTORC2 and Akt. Pretreatment with ChK was able to significantly decrease phosphorylation at Akt S473 similarly to Torin1 with either IGF-1 or calyculin A treatment. Moreover, the autophosphorylation site on complex mTORC2, S2481, was also significantly reduced with ChK pretreatment, similar to Torin1. This is the first report to illustrate that ChK has a significant effect at mTORC2 S2481 and Akt S473 comparable to Torin1, indicating that it may be a mTOR inhibitor.",

Akt is activated by phosphorylation at T308 via PI3K and S473 via mTORC2. The importance of PI3K-activated Akt signaling is well documented in HER2-amplified breast cancer models, but the significance of mTORC2-activated Akt signaling in this setting remains uncertain. We report here that the mTORC2 obligate cofactor Rictor is enriched in HER2-amplified samples, correlating with increased phosphorylation at S473 on Akt. In invasive breast cancer specimens, Rictor expression was upregulated significantly compared with nonmalignant tissues. In a HER2/Neu mouse model of breast cancer, genetic ablation of Rictor decreased cell survival and phosphorylation at S473 on Akt, delaying tumor latency, penetrance, and burden. In HER2-amplified cells, exposure to an mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor decreased Akt-dependent cell survival, including in cells resistant to lapatinib, where cytotoxicity could be restored. We replicated these findings by silencing Rictor in breast cancer cell lines, but not silencing the mTORC1 cofactor Raptor (RPTOR). Taken together, our findings establish that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling drives Akt-dependent tumor progression in HER2-amplified breast cancers, rationalizing clinical investigation of dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitors and developing mTORC2-specific inhibitors for use in this setting.

            "abstract": "MAPK4 is an atypical MAPK. Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tetrameric α(2)-macroglobulin (α(2)M), a plasma panproteinase inhibitor, is activated upon interaction with a proteinase, and undergoes a major conformational change exposing a receptor recognition site in each of its subunits. Activated α(2)M (α(2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of α(2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies. RESULTS: Stimulation of cells with α(2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. α(2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced α(2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. α(2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces α(2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates. CONCLUSION: Binding of α(2)M* to prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 upregulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and promotes protein synthesis in the prostate cancer cells.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: mTOR kinase inhibitors block mTORC1 and mTORC2 and thus do not cause the mTORC2 activation of AKT observed with rapamycin. We now show, however, that these drugs have a biphasic effect on AKT. Inhibition of mTORC2 leads to AKT serine 473 (S473) dephosphorylation and a rapid but transient inhibition of AKT T308 phosphorylation and AKT signaling. However, inhibition of mTOR kinase also relieves feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to subsequent phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation and rephosphorylation of AKT T308 sufficient to reactivate AKT activity and signaling. Thus, catalytic inhibition of mTOR kinase leads to a new steady state characterized by profound suppression of mTORC1 and accumulation of activated AKT phosphorylated on T308, but not S473. Combined inhibition of mTOR kinase and the induced RTKs fully abolishes AKT signaling and results in substantial cell death and tumor regression in vivo. These findings reveal the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks and the limitations of monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks, as AKT signaling becomes reactivated through a feedback-induced AKT species phosphorylated on T308 but lacking S473. The addition of RTK inhibitors can prevent this reactivation of AKT signaling and cause profound cell death and tumor regression in vivo, highlighting the possible need for combinatorial approaches to block feedback-regulated pathways.",

            "abstract": "Resistance of breast cancers to targeted hormone receptor (HR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors often occurs through dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase B/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway. Presently, no targeted therapies exist for breast cancers lacking HR and HER2 overexpression, many of which also exhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyper-activation. Resistance of breast cancers to current therapeutics also results, in part, from aberrant epigenetic modifications including protein acetylation regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show that the investigational drug MLN0128, which inhibits both complexes of mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2), and the hydroxamic acid pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA synergistically inhibit the viability of a phenotypically diverse panel of five breast cancer cell lines (HR-/+, HER2-/+). The combination of MLN0128 and TSA induces apoptosis in most breast cancer cell lines tested, but not in the non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. In parallel, the MLN0128/TSA combination reduces phosphorylation of AKT at S473 more than single agents alone and more so in the 5 malignant breast cancer cell lines than in the non-malignant mammary epithelial cells. Examining polysome profiles from one of the most sensitive breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3), we demonstrate that this MLN0128/TSA treatment combination synergistically impairs polysome assembly in conjunction with enhanced inhibition of 4eBP1 phosphorylation at S65. Taken together, these data indicate that the synergistic growth inhibiting consequence of combining a mTORC1/C2 inhibitor like MLN0128 with a pan-HDAC inhibitor like TSA results from their mechanistic convergence onto the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, profoundly inhibiting both AKT S473 and 4eBP1 S65 phosphorylation, reducing polysome formation and cancer cell viability.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been reported that PI3K/AKT pathway is altered in various cancers and AKT isoforms specifically regulate cell growth and metastasis of cancer cells; AKT1, but not AKT2, reduces invasion of cancer cells but maintains cancer growth. We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2, that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells via AKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity. METHODS: Transduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression in various cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays can evaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473 residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in various human breast cancer tissues. RESULTS: We observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducing Raptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead to significant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breast cancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase, indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, the TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: TIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis and downregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2 pathway.",

RAD001 (everolimus), an mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor) inhibitor, has broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and cancer patients. Although most tumor lines are RAD001 sensitive, some are not. Selective mTORC1 inhibition can elicit increased AKT S473 phosphorylation, involving insulin receptor substrate 1, which is suggested to potentially attenuate effects on tumor cell proliferation and viability. Rictor may also play a role because rictor kinase complexes (including mTOR/rictor) regulate AKT S473 phosphorylation. The role of raptor and rictor in the in vitro response of human cancer cells to RAD001 was investigated. Using a large panel of cell lines representing different tumor histotypes, the basal phosphorylation of AKT S473 and some AKT substrates was found to correlate with the antiproliferative response to RAD001. In contrast, increased AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by RAD001 did not correlate. Similar increases in AKT phosphorylation occurred following raptor depletion using siRNA. Strikingly, rictor down-regulation attenuated AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition. Further analyses showed no relationship between modulation of AKT phosphorylation on S473 and T308 and AKT substrate phosphorylation patterns. Using a dual pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR catalytic inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235), currently in phase I trials, concomitant targeting of these kinases inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation, eliciting more profound cellular responses than mTORC1 inhibition alone. However, reduced cell viability could not be predicted from biochemical or cellular responses to mTORC1 inhibitors. These data could have implications for the clinical application of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR inhibitors.",

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are aberrantly activated in many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which may indicate an association with breast cancer chemoresistance. In this study, we generated a chemoresistant human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231/gemcitabine (simplified hereafter as \"231/Gem\"), from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry studies revealed that with the same treatment concentration of gemcitabine, 231/Gem cells displayed more robust resistance to gemcitabine, which was reflected by fewer apoptotic cells and enhanced percentage of S-phase cells. Through the use of inverted microscopy, Cell Counting Kit-8, and Transwell assays, we found that compared with parental 231 cells, 231/Gem cells displayed more morphologic projections, enhanced cell proliferative ability, and improved cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem in comparison to control cells. However, there was no change in the expression of Cyclin D1 and p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In culture, inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and mTOR, but not of MEK/MAPK, could reverse the enhanced proliferative ability of 231/Gem cells. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor decreased the expression levels of p-AKT, p-MEK, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K; however, treatments with either MEK/MAPK or mTOR inhibitor significantly increased p-AKT expression. Thus, our data suggest that gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells is mainly mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This occurs through elevated expression of p-AKT protein to promote cell proliferation and is negatively regulated by the MEK/MAPK and mTOR pathways.",

MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.",

In this study, we observed that epimagnolin, a natural compound abundantly found in Shin-Yi, suppressed cell proliferation by inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced G1/S cell-cycle phase transition in JB6 Cl41 cells. Interestingly, epimagnolin suppressed EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation strongly at Ser473 and weakly at Thr308 without alteration of phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), and RSK1, resulting in abrogation of the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 and p70S6K at Thr389. Moreover, we found that epimagnolin suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73, resulting in the inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation activity. Computational docking indicated that epimagnolin targeted an active pocket of the mTOR kinase domain by forming three hydrogen bonds and three hydrophobic interactions. The prediction was confirmed by using in vitro kinase and adenosine triphosphate-bead competition assays. The inhibition of mTOR kinase activity resulted in the suppression of anchorage-independent cell transformation. Importantly, epimagnolin efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth of H1650 rather than H460 lung cancer cells with dependency of total and phosphorylated protein levels of mTOR and Akt. Inhibitory signaling of epimagnolin on cell proliferation of lung cancer cells was observed mainly in mTOR-Akt-p70S6K and mTOR-Akt-GSK3β-AP-1, which was similar to that shown in JB6 Cl41 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that epimagnolin potentiates as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents by direct active pocket targeting of mTOR kinase, resulting in sensitizing cancer cells harboring enhanced phosphorylation of the mTORC2-Akt-p70S6k signaling pathway.",

            "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The importance of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling complex in tumor progression is becoming increasingly recognized. HER2-amplified breast cancers use Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to drive tumor formation, tumor cell survival and resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. Cell motility, a key step in the metastatic process, can be activated by mTORC2 in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, but its role in promoting metastases from HER2-amplified breast cancers is not yet clear. METHODS: Because Rictor is an obligate cofactor of mTORC2, we genetically engineered Rictor ablation or overexpression in mouse and human HER2-amplified breast cancer models for modulation of mTORC2 activity. Signaling through mTORC2-dependent pathways was also manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, Akt, and Rac. Signaling was assessed by western analysis and biochemical pull-down assays specific for Rac-GTP and for active Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Metastases were assessed from spontaneous tumors and from intravenously delivered tumor cells. Motility and invasion of cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays. RESULTS: We found that Rictor ablation potently impaired, while Rictor overexpression increased, metastasis in spontaneous and intravenously seeded models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Additionally, migration and invasion of HER2-amplified human breast cancer cells was diminished in the absence of Rictor, or upon pharmacological mTOR kinase inhibition. Active Rac1 was required for Rictor-dependent invasion and motility, which rescued invasion/motility in Rictor depleted cells. Rictor/mTORC2-dependent dampening of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor RhoGDI2, a factor that correlated directly with increased overall survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer patients, promoted Rac1 activity and tumor cell invasion/migration. The mTORC2 substrate Akt did not affect RhoGDI2 dampening, but partially increased Rac1 activity through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, thus partially rescuing cell invasion/motility. The mTORC2 effector protein kinase C (PKC)α did rescue Rictor-mediated RhoGDI2 downregulation, partially rescuing Rac-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and migration/motility. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mTORC2 uses two coordinated pathways to activate cell invasion/motility, both of which converge on Rac1. Akt signaling activates Rac1 through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, while PKC signaling dampens expression of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor, RhoGDI2.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of various cellular responses by forming two functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). mTOR inhibitors have been used in attempts to treat these lesions, and prolonged progression free survival has been recorded. If this holds true also for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associated PNETs is yet unclear. We investigated the relationship between expression of the MEN1 protein menin and mTOR signaling in the presence or absence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. METHODS: In addition to use of menin wild type and menin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), menin was silenced by siRNA in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell line BON-1. Panels of protein phosphorylation, as activation markers downstream of PI3k-mTOR-Akt pathways, as well as menin expression were evaluated by immunoblotting. The impact of menin expression in the presence and absence of rapamycin was determinate upon Wound healing, migration and proliferation in MEFs and BON1 cells. RESULTS: PDGF-BB markedly increased phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrate Akt, at serine 473 (S473) and threonine 450 (T450) in menin-/- MEFs but did not alter phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates ribosomal protein S6 or eIF4B. Acute rapamycin treatment by mTORC1-S6 inhibition caused a greater enhancement of Akt phosphorylation on S473 in menin-/- cells as compared to menin+/+ MEFs (116% vs 38%). Chronic rapamycin treatment, which inhibits both mTORC1and 2, reduced Akt phosphorylation of S473 to a lesser extent in menin-/- MEFs than menin+/+ MEFs (25% vs 75%). Silencing of menin expression in human PNET cell line (BON1) also enhanced Akt phosphorylation at S473, but not activation of mTORC1. Interestingly, silencing menin in BON1 cells elevated S473 phosphorylation of Akt in both acute and chronic treatments with rapamycin. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on serum mediated wound healing and cell migration is impaired in menin-/- MEFs, as well as in menin-silenced BON1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Menin is involved in regulatory mechanism between the two mTOR complexes, and its reduced expression is accompanied with increased mTORC2-Akt signaling, which consequently impairs anti-migratory effect of rapamycin.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activated B-Raf alone cannot induce melanoma but must cooperate with other signaling pathways. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathways are critical for tumorigenesis. The authors investigated the role of these pathways in uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: The effects of PI3K and mTOR activation and inhibition on the proliferation of human uveal melanoma cell lines expressing either activated (WT)B-Raf or (V600E)B-Raf were investigated. Interactions among PI3K, mTOR, and B-Raf/ERK were studied. RESULTS: Inhibition of PI3K deactivated P70S6 kinase, reduced cell proliferation by 71% to 84%, and increased apoptosis by a factor of 5.0 to 8.4 without reducing ERK1/2 activation, indicating that ERK plays no role in mediating PI3K in these processes. In contrast, rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR did not significantly affect cell proliferation because it simultaneously stimulated PI3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 expression. Regardless of B-Raf mutation status, cotreatment with the PI3K inhibitor effectively sensitized all melanoma cell lines to the B-Raf or ERK1/2 inhibition-induced reduction of cell proliferation. B-Raf/ERK and PI3K signaling, but not mTOR signaling, converged to control cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, p70S6K required the activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K interact with B-Raf/ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Activated PI3K/Akt attenuates the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on cell proliferation and thus serves as a negative feedback mechanism. This finding suggests that rapamycin is unlikely to inhibit uveal melanoma growth. In contrast, targeting PI3K while inhibiting B-Raf/ERK may be a promising approach to reduce the proliferation of uveal melanoma cells.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2) are overactive in colorectal carcinomas; however, the first generation of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin have failed to show clinical benefits in treating colorectal carcinoma in part due to their effects only on mTORC1. The second generation of mTOR inhibitors such as PP242 targets mTOR kinase; thus, they are capable of inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2. To examine the therapeutic potential of the mTOR kinase inhibitors, we treated a panel of colorectal carcinoma cell lines with PP242. Western blotting showed that the PP242 inhibition of mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation at Ser 473 (AKT(S473)) was transient only in the first few hours of the PP242 treatment. Receptor tyrosine kinase arrays further revealed that PP242 treatment increased the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Tyr 1068 (EGFR(T1068)). The parallel increase of AKT(S473) and EGFR(T1068) in the cells following PP242 treatment raised the possibility that EGFR phosphorylation might contribute to the PP242 incomplete inhibition of mTORC2. To test this notion, we showed that the combination of PP242 with erlotinib, an EGFR small molecule inhibitor, blocked both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity. In addition, we showed that the combination treatment inhibited colony formation, blocked cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. A systemic administration of PP242 and erlotinib resulted in the progression suppression of colorectal carcinoma xenografts in mice. This study suggests that the combination of mTOR kinase and EGFR inhibitors may provide an effective treatment of colorectal carcinoma.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. miR‑653‑5p was previously reported to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of miR‑653‑5p in the progression of breast cancer has not been studied. In the present study, it was found that overexpression of miR‑653‑5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR‑653‑5p promoted cell apoptosis in breast cancer by regulating the Bcl‑2/Bax axis and caspase‑9 activation. Additionally, the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were also inhibited by miR‑653‑5p. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that miR‑653‑5p directly targeted mitogen‑activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) and negatively regulated its expression in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of MAPK6 could overcome the inhibitory effects of miR‑653‑5p on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer. In conclusion, this study suggested that miR‑653‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAPK6 in the progression of breast cancer, and it may be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",

Therefore, currently, we focused on the biological and clinical significance of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and hsa-mir-98-5p in NSCLC. It was observed that NEAT1 was upregulated while hsa-mir-98-5p was downregulated respectively in NSCLC cell lines compared to human normal lung epithelial BES-2B cells. Inhibition of NEAT1 can suppress the progression of NSCLC cells and hsa-mir-98-5p can reverse this phenomenon. Bioinformatics search was used to elucidate the correlation between NEAT1 and hsa-mir-98-5p. Additionally, a novel messenger RNA target of hsa-mir-98-5p, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), was predicted. Overexpression and knockdown studies were conducted to verify whether NEAT1 exhibits its biological functions through regulating hsa-mir-98-5p and MAPK6 in vitro. NEAT1 was able to increase MAPK6 expression and hsa-mir-98-5p mimics can inhibit MAPK6 via downregulating NEAT1 levels. We speculated that NEAT1 may act as a competing endogenous lncRNA to upregulate MAPK6 by attaching hsa-mir-98-5p in lung cancers. Taken these together, NEAT1/hsa-mir-98-5p/MAPK6 is involved in the development and progress in NSCLC. NEAT1 could be recommended as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic indicator in NSCLC diagnosis and treatment.",

In part, this results from activation of adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cAMP. We have previously employed the cAMP analog 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP to probe these responses. Here we show in 1-LN prostate cancer cells that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP causes a dose-dependent increase in Epac1, p-Akt(T308) , p-Akt(S473) , but not p-CREB. By contrast, the PKA activator 6-Benz-cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in p-CREB, but not Epac1. We measured mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation at S473 in immunoprecipitates of mTOR or Rictor from 1-LN cells. 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP caused a two-threefold increase in p-Akt(S473) and Akt(S473) kinase activity in Rictor immunoprecipitates. By contrast, there was only a negligible effect on p-Akt(T308) in Rictor immunoprecipitates. Silencing Rictor gene expression by RNAi significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) . These studies represent the first report that Epac1 mediates mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt(S473) . Pretreatment of these cells with the PI 3-Kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-dependent p-Akt(S473) and p-Akt(S473) kinase activities, and both effects were rapamycin insensitive. This treatment caused a two to threefold increase in S6 Kinase and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, indices of mTORC1 activation. Pretreatment of the cells with LY294002 and rapamycin significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. We further demonstrate that in 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-treated cells, Epac1 co-immunoprecipitates with AKAP, Raptor, Rictor, PDE3B, and PDE4D suggesting thereby that during Epac1-induced activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, Epac1 may have an additional function as a \"scaffold\" protein.",

In P2X7R knockout (KO) mice, prolonged astroglial HSP25 induction exerts 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1-mediated autophagic pathway independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity following KA injection. Sustained HSP25 expression also enhances AKT-serine (S) 473 phosphorylation leading to astroglial autophagy via glycogen synthase kinase-3β/bax interacting factor 1 signaling pathway. However, it is unanswered how P2X7R deletion induces AKT-S473 hyperphosphorylation during autophagic process in astrocytes. In the present study, we found that AKT-S473 phosphorylation was increased by enhancing activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), independent of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 activities in isolated astrocytes of P2X7R knockout (KO) mice following KA injection. In addition, HSP25 overexpression in P2X7R KO mice acted as a chaperone of AKT, which retained AKT-S473 phosphorylation by inhibiting the pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) 1- and 2-binding to AKT. Therefore, our findings suggest that P2X7R may be a fine-tuner of AKT-S473 activity during astroglial autophagy by regulating FAK phosphorylation and HSP25-mediated inhibition of PHLPP1/2-AKT binding following KA treatment.",

Recent discoveries indicate that the complex crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and multiple interacting cell signaling cascades can further promote prostate cancer progression and influence the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PI3K-AKT-mTOR-targeted therapies being explored in the clinic, as well as standard treatment approaches such as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the full extent of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network during prostate tumorigenesis, invasive progression and disease recurrence remains to be determined. In this review, we outline the emerging diversity of the genetic alterations that lead to activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer, and discuss new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and several key interacting oncogenic signaling cascades that can cooperate to facilitate prostate cancer growth and drug-resistance, specifically the androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and WNT signaling cascades. Ultimately, deepening our understanding of the broader PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is crucial to aid patient stratification for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-directed therapies, and to discover new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer that improve patient outcome.",

Previous analysis of mice with a targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter in the Mapk6 locus (Mapk6lacZ ) showed that inactivation of ERK3 in Mapk6lacZ mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with intrauterine growth restriction, defective lung maturation, and neuromuscular anomalies. To further explore the role of ERK3 in physiology and disease, we generated novel mouse models expressing a catalytically inactive (Mapk6KD ) or conditional (Mapk6Δ ) allele of ERK3. Surprisingly, we found that mice devoid of ERK3 kinase activity or expression survive the perinatal period without any observable lung or neuromuscular phenotype. ERK3 mutant mice reached adulthood, were fertile, and showed no apparent health problem. However, analysis of growth curves revealed that ERK3 kinase activity is necessary for optimal postnatal growth. To gain insight into the genetic basis underlying the discrepancy in phenotypes of different Mapk6 mutant mouse models, we analyzed the regulation of genes flanking the Mapk6 locus by quantitative PCR. We found that the expression of several Mapk6 neighboring genes is deregulated in Mapk6lacZ mice but not in Mapk6KD or Mapk6Δ mutant mice. Our genetic analysis suggests that off-target effects of the targeting construct on local gene expression are responsible for the perinatal lethality phenotype of Mapk6lacZ mutant mice.",

We show for the first time, with the use of both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, that the kinase activity and S473 phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA and S1P requires both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase, and MEK is likely to be upstream of p38, in HEY ovarian cancer cells. The requirement for both MEK and p38 is cell type- and stimulus-specific. Among 12 cell lines that we tested, 11 respond to LPA and S1P and all of the responsive cell lines require p38 but only nine of them require MEK. Among different stimuli tested, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates S473 phosphorylation of Akt in a MEK- and p38-dependent manner. However, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and endothelin-1-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation require p38 but not MEK. Insulin, on the other hand, stimulates Akt S473 phosphorylation independent of both MEK and p38 in HEY cells. T308 phosphorylation stimulated by LPA/S1P requires MEK but not p38 activation. MEK and p38 activation were sufficient for Akt S473 but not T308 phosphorylation in HEY cells. In contrast to S1P and PDGF, LPA requires Rho for Akt S473 phosphorylation, and Rho is upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). LPA/S1P-induced Akt activation may be involved in cell survival, because LPA and S1P treatment in HEY ovarian cancer cells results in a decrease in paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 activity in a PI3-K/MEK/p38-dependent manner.",

            "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) is frequently dysregulated in disorders of cell growth and survival, including a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. The pathway can be abnormally activated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as well as in some pediatric lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most commonly, this abnormal activation occurs as a consequence of constitutive activation of AKT, providing a compelling rationale to target this pathway in many of these conditions. A variety of agents, beginning with the rapamycin analogue (rapalog) sirolimus, have been used successfully to target this pathway in a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. Rapalogs demonstrate significant preclinical activity against ALL, which has led to a number of clinical trials. Moreover, rapalogs can synergize with a number of conventional cytotoxic agents and overcome pathways of chemotherapeutic resistance for drugs commonly used in ALL treatment, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Based on preclinical data, rapalogs are also being studied in AML, CML, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently, significant progress has been made using rapalogs to treat pre-malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, including the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS); complete remissions in children with otherwise therapy-resistant disease have been seen. Rapalogs only block one component of the pathway (mTORC1), and newer agents are under preclinical and clinical development that can target different and often multiple protein kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Most of these agents have been tolerated in early-phase clinical trials. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under investigation. Of note, most of these also target other protein kinases. Newer agents are under development that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTORC1 and PI3K, and the triad of PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2. Preclinical data suggest these dual- and multi-kinase inhibitors are more potent than rapalogs against many of the aforementioned hematologic malignancies. Two classes of AKT inhibitors are under development, the alkyl-lysophospholipids (APLs) and small molecule AKT inhibitors. Both classes have agents currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development that target other components of the pathway, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E (eIF4E) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Finally, a number of other key signaling pathways interact with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, including Notch, MNK, Syk, MAPK, and aurora kinase. These alternative pathways are being targeted alone and in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with promising preclinical results in pediatric hematologic malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in pediatric hematologic malignancies, the agents that are used to target this pathway, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, using those agents in childhood hematologic cancers.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-mediated tumorigenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and correlated with unfavorable outcome in certain types of other cancers. However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL. METHODS: A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells. RESULTS: ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

            "abstract": "AIMS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown dramatic clinical benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance remains a serious problem in clinical practice. The present study analyzed mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between the EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines and investigated the feasibility of targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitor in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells. METHODS: We selected four different types of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells: PC9, PC9GR, H1650 and H1975 cells as models to detect mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences by western blot and Immunoprecipitation and evaluated the antiproliferative effect and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 by MTT method and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the present study, we observed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway in a basal state was highly activated in resistant cells. In vitro mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities assays showed that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity in the basal state. The ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 showed dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ku-0063794 at the IC50 concentration effectively inhibited both mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation levels; the latter is an mTORC1 substrate and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation which would be induced by rapamycin and resulted in partial inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation. We also observed that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant clinical NSCLC tumor specimens had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated.",

The reciprocal relation that exists between the two activating phosphorylation sites of Akt, T308 and S473, and the two mTOR complexes, C1 and C2, forms the central controlling hub that regulates these cellular functions. In our previous review \"PI3Kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in cell cycle\" we discussed the reciprocal relation between mTORC1 and C2 complexes in regulating cell metabolism and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. We present in this article, a hypothesis that activation of Akt-T308 phosphorylation in the presence of high ATP:AMP ratio promotes the stability of its phosphorylations and activates mTORC1 and the energy consuming biosynthetic processes. Depletion of energy leads to inactivation of mTORC1, activation of AMPK, FoxO, and promotes constitution of mTORC2 that leads to phosphorylation of Akt S473. Akt can also be activated independent of PI3K; this appears to have an advantage under situations like dietary restrictions, where insulin/insulin growth factor signaling could be a casualty.",

Recent studies indicate mTORC2 is emerging as a promising cancer therapeutic target. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of targeting mTORC1 with mTORC2 on a variety of breast cancer cell lines and xenograft. We demonstrated that inhibition of mTORC1/2 by mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242 and OSI-027 effectively suppress phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and breast cancer cell proliferation. Targeting of mTORC2 either by kinase inhibitors or rictor knockdown, but not inhibition of mTORC1 either by rapamycin or raptor knockdown promotes serum starvation- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, targeting of mTORC2 but not mTORC1 efficiently prevent breast cancer cell migration. Most importantly, in vivo administration of PP242 but not rapamycin as single agent effectively prevents breast tumor growth and induces apoptosis in xenograft. Our data suggest that agents that inhibit mTORC2 may have advantages over selective mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers. Given that mTOR kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials, this study provides a strong rationale for testing the use of mTOR kinase inhibitors or combination of mTOR kinase inhibitors and cisplatin in the clinic.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although it is known that mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) functions upstream of Akt, the role of this protein kinase complex in cancer is not well understood. Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-κB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-κB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-κB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that EGFRvIII-activated mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance through Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. These results highlight the role of mTORC2 as an integrator of two canonical signaling networks that are commonly altered in cancer, EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and NF-κB. These results also validate the importance of mTORC2 as a cancer target and provide new insights into its role in mediating chemotherapy resistance, suggesting new treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "To select the appropriate patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), it is important to gain a better understanding of the intracellular pathways leading to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is a common problem in patients with lung cancer. We recently reported that mutant KRAS adenocarcinoma is resistant to gefitinib as a result of amphiregulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor overexpression. This resistance leads to inhibition of Ku70 acetylation, thus enhancing the BAX/Ku70 interaction and preventing apoptosis. Here, we determined the intracellular pathways involved in gefitinib resistance in lung cancers and explored the impact of their inhibition. We analyzed the activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway in lung tumors. The activation of AKT was associated with disease progression in tumors with wild-type EGFR from patients treated with gefitinib (phase II clinical trial IFCT0401). The administration of IGF1R-TKI or amphiregulin-directed shRNA decreased AKT signaling and restored gefitinib sensitivity in mutant KRAS cells. The combination of PI3K/AKT inhibition with gefitinib restored apoptosis via Ku70 downregulation and BAX release from Ku70. Deacetylase inhibitors, which decreased the BAX/Ku70 interaction, inhibited AKT signaling and induced gefitinib-dependent apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thus a major pathway contributing to gefitinib resistance in lung tumors with KRAS mutation, through the regulation of the BAX/Ku70 interaction. This finding suggests that combined treatments could improve the outcomes for this subset of lung cancer patients, who have a poor prognosis.",

            "abstract": "MAPK4 is an atypical MAPK. Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activated B-Raf alone cannot induce melanoma but must cooperate with other signaling pathways. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathways are critical for tumorigenesis. The authors investigated the role of these pathways in uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: The effects of PI3K and mTOR activation and inhibition on the proliferation of human uveal melanoma cell lines expressing either activated (WT)B-Raf or (V600E)B-Raf were investigated. Interactions among PI3K, mTOR, and B-Raf/ERK were studied. RESULTS: Inhibition of PI3K deactivated P70S6 kinase, reduced cell proliferation by 71% to 84%, and increased apoptosis by a factor of 5.0 to 8.4 without reducing ERK1/2 activation, indicating that ERK plays no role in mediating PI3K in these processes. In contrast, rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR did not significantly affect cell proliferation because it simultaneously stimulated PI3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 expression. Regardless of B-Raf mutation status, cotreatment with the PI3K inhibitor effectively sensitized all melanoma cell lines to the B-Raf or ERK1/2 inhibition-induced reduction of cell proliferation. B-Raf/ERK and PI3K signaling, but not mTOR signaling, converged to control cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, p70S6K required the activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K interact with B-Raf/ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Activated PI3K/Akt attenuates the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on cell proliferation and thus serves as a negative feedback mechanism. This finding suggests that rapamycin is unlikely to inhibit uveal melanoma growth. In contrast, targeting PI3K while inhibiting B-Raf/ERK may be a promising approach to reduce the proliferation of uveal melanoma cells.",

            "abstract": "The physiological functions of the atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) remain poorly characterized. Previous analysis of mice with a targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter in the Mapk6 locus (Mapk6lacZ ) showed that inactivation of ERK3 in Mapk6lacZ mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with intrauterine growth restriction, defective lung maturation, and neuromuscular anomalies. To further explore the role of ERK3 in physiology and disease, we generated novel mouse models expressing a catalytically inactive (Mapk6KD ) or conditional (Mapk6Δ ) allele of ERK3. Surprisingly, we found that mice devoid of ERK3 kinase activity or expression survive the perinatal period without any observable lung or neuromuscular phenotype. ERK3 mutant mice reached adulthood, were fertile, and showed no apparent health problem. However, analysis of growth curves revealed that ERK3 kinase activity is necessary for optimal postnatal growth. To gain insight into the genetic basis underlying the discrepancy in phenotypes of different Mapk6 mutant mouse models, we analyzed the regulation of genes flanking the Mapk6 locus by quantitative PCR. We found that the expression of several Mapk6 neighboring genes is deregulated in Mapk6lacZ mice but not in Mapk6KD or Mapk6Δ mutant mice. Our genetic analysis suggests that off-target effects of the targeting construct on local gene expression are responsible for the perinatal lethality phenotype of Mapk6lacZ mutant mice.",

            "abstract": "Resistance of breast cancers to targeted hormone receptor (HR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors often occurs through dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase B/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway. Presently, no targeted therapies exist for breast cancers lacking HR and HER2 overexpression, many of which also exhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyper-activation. Resistance of breast cancers to current therapeutics also results, in part, from aberrant epigenetic modifications including protein acetylation regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show that the investigational drug MLN0128, which inhibits both complexes of mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2), and the hydroxamic acid pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA synergistically inhibit the viability of a phenotypically diverse panel of five breast cancer cell lines (HR-/+, HER2-/+). The combination of MLN0128 and TSA induces apoptosis in most breast cancer cell lines tested, but not in the non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. In parallel, the MLN0128/TSA combination reduces phosphorylation of AKT at S473 more than single agents alone and more so in the 5 malignant breast cancer cell lines than in the non-malignant mammary epithelial cells. Examining polysome profiles from one of the most sensitive breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3), we demonstrate that this MLN0128/TSA treatment combination synergistically impairs polysome assembly in conjunction with enhanced inhibition of 4eBP1 phosphorylation at S65. Taken together, these data indicate that the synergistic growth inhibiting consequence of combining a mTORC1/C2 inhibitor like MLN0128 with a pan-HDAC inhibitor like TSA results from their mechanistic convergence onto the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, profoundly inhibiting both AKT S473 and 4eBP1 S65 phosphorylation, reducing polysome formation and cancer cell viability.",

In part, this results from activation of adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cAMP. We have previously employed the cAMP analog 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP to probe these responses. Here we show in 1-LN prostate cancer cells that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP causes a dose-dependent increase in Epac1, p-Akt(T308) , p-Akt(S473) , but not p-CREB. By contrast, the PKA activator 6-Benz-cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in p-CREB, but not Epac1. We measured mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation at S473 in immunoprecipitates of mTOR or Rictor from 1-LN cells. 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP caused a two-threefold increase in p-Akt(S473) and Akt(S473) kinase activity in Rictor immunoprecipitates. By contrast, there was only a negligible effect on p-Akt(T308) in Rictor immunoprecipitates. Silencing Rictor gene expression by RNAi significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) . These studies represent the first report that Epac1 mediates mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt(S473) . Pretreatment of these cells with the PI 3-Kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-dependent p-Akt(S473) and p-Akt(S473) kinase activities, and both effects were rapamycin insensitive. This treatment caused a two to threefold increase in S6 Kinase and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, indices of mTORC1 activation. Pretreatment of the cells with LY294002 and rapamycin significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. We further demonstrate that in 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-treated cells, Epac1 co-immunoprecipitates with AKAP, Raptor, Rictor, PDE3B, and PDE4D suggesting thereby that during Epac1-induced activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, Epac1 may have an additional function as a \"scaffold\" protein.",

ChK also has been shown to downregulate two important kinases involved in oncogenic pathways, Akt and JNK. This report investigates how ChK is involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (RTK/PI3K/mTORC2/Akt) to the centrally located protein kinase, Akt. Studies have reported that ChK does not inhibit PI3K comparable to wortmannin and does not affect PDK1 activation. PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylation on Akt T308, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt S473. Yet, Akt's two activation sites, T308 and S473, are known to be affected by ChK treatment. It was our hypothesis that ChK acts on the mTORC2 complex to inhibit the phosphorylation seen at Akt S473. This inhibition at mTORC2 should decrease phosphorylation at both these proteins, Akt and mTORC2 complex, compared to a known mTOR specific inhibitor, Torin1. Human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and H2009 cells were treated with IGF-1 or calyculin A to increase phosphorylation at complex mTORC2 and Akt. Pretreatment with ChK was able to significantly decrease phosphorylation at Akt S473 similarly to Torin1 with either IGF-1 or calyculin A treatment. Moreover, the autophosphorylation site on complex mTORC2, S2481, was also significantly reduced with ChK pretreatment, similar to Torin1. This is the first report to illustrate that ChK has a significant effect at mTORC2 S2481 and Akt S473 comparable to Torin1, indicating that it may be a mTOR inhibitor.",

Therefore, currently, we focused on the biological and clinical significance of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and hsa-mir-98-5p in NSCLC. It was observed that NEAT1 was upregulated while hsa-mir-98-5p was downregulated respectively in NSCLC cell lines compared to human normal lung epithelial BES-2B cells. Inhibition of NEAT1 can suppress the progression of NSCLC cells and hsa-mir-98-5p can reverse this phenomenon. Bioinformatics search was used to elucidate the correlation between NEAT1 and hsa-mir-98-5p. Additionally, a novel messenger RNA target of hsa-mir-98-5p, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), was predicted. Overexpression and knockdown studies were conducted to verify whether NEAT1 exhibits its biological functions through regulating hsa-mir-98-5p and MAPK6 in vitro. NEAT1 was able to increase MAPK6 expression and hsa-mir-98-5p mimics can inhibit MAPK6 via downregulating NEAT1 levels. We speculated that NEAT1 may act as a competing endogenous lncRNA to upregulate MAPK6 by attaching hsa-mir-98-5p in lung cancers. Taken these together, NEAT1/hsa-mir-98-5p/MAPK6 is involved in the development and progress in NSCLC. NEAT1 could be recommended as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic indicator in NSCLC diagnosis and treatment.",

            "abstract": "HER2 overexpression drives Akt signaling and cell survival and HER2-enriched breast tumors have a poor outcome when Akt is upregulated. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at T308 via PI3K and S473 via mTORC2. The importance of PI3K-activated Akt signaling is well documented in HER2-amplified breast cancer models, but the significance of mTORC2-activated Akt signaling in this setting remains uncertain. We report here that the mTORC2 obligate cofactor Rictor is enriched in HER2-amplified samples, correlating with increased phosphorylation at S473 on Akt. In invasive breast cancer specimens, Rictor expression was upregulated significantly compared with nonmalignant tissues. In a HER2/Neu mouse model of breast cancer, genetic ablation of Rictor decreased cell survival and phosphorylation at S473 on Akt, delaying tumor latency, penetrance, and burden. In HER2-amplified cells, exposure to an mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor decreased Akt-dependent cell survival, including in cells resistant to lapatinib, where cytotoxicity could be restored. We replicated these findings by silencing Rictor in breast cancer cell lines, but not silencing the mTORC1 cofactor Raptor (RPTOR). Taken together, our findings establish that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling drives Akt-dependent tumor progression in HER2-amplified breast cancers, rationalizing clinical investigation of dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitors and developing mTORC2-specific inhibitors for use in this setting.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The importance of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling complex in tumor progression is becoming increasingly recognized. HER2-amplified breast cancers use Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to drive tumor formation, tumor cell survival and resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. Cell motility, a key step in the metastatic process, can be activated by mTORC2 in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, but its role in promoting metastases from HER2-amplified breast cancers is not yet clear. METHODS: Because Rictor is an obligate cofactor of mTORC2, we genetically engineered Rictor ablation or overexpression in mouse and human HER2-amplified breast cancer models for modulation of mTORC2 activity. Signaling through mTORC2-dependent pathways was also manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, Akt, and Rac. Signaling was assessed by western analysis and biochemical pull-down assays specific for Rac-GTP and for active Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Metastases were assessed from spontaneous tumors and from intravenously delivered tumor cells. Motility and invasion of cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays. RESULTS: We found that Rictor ablation potently impaired, while Rictor overexpression increased, metastasis in spontaneous and intravenously seeded models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Additionally, migration and invasion of HER2-amplified human breast cancer cells was diminished in the absence of Rictor, or upon pharmacological mTOR kinase inhibition. Active Rac1 was required for Rictor-dependent invasion and motility, which rescued invasion/motility in Rictor depleted cells. Rictor/mTORC2-dependent dampening of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor RhoGDI2, a factor that correlated directly with increased overall survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer patients, promoted Rac1 activity and tumor cell invasion/migration. The mTORC2 substrate Akt did not affect RhoGDI2 dampening, but partially increased Rac1 activity through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, thus partially rescuing cell invasion/motility. The mTORC2 effector protein kinase C (PKC)α did rescue Rictor-mediated RhoGDI2 downregulation, partially rescuing Rac-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and migration/motility. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mTORC2 uses two coordinated pathways to activate cell invasion/motility, both of which converge on Rac1. Akt signaling activates Rac1 through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, while PKC signaling dampens expression of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor, RhoGDI2.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2) are overactive in colorectal carcinomas; however, the first generation of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin have failed to show clinical benefits in treating colorectal carcinoma in part due to their effects only on mTORC1. The second generation of mTOR inhibitors such as PP242 targets mTOR kinase; thus, they are capable of inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2. To examine the therapeutic potential of the mTOR kinase inhibitors, we treated a panel of colorectal carcinoma cell lines with PP242. Western blotting showed that the PP242 inhibition of mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation at Ser 473 (AKT(S473)) was transient only in the first few hours of the PP242 treatment. Receptor tyrosine kinase arrays further revealed that PP242 treatment increased the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Tyr 1068 (EGFR(T1068)). The parallel increase of AKT(S473) and EGFR(T1068) in the cells following PP242 treatment raised the possibility that EGFR phosphorylation might contribute to the PP242 incomplete inhibition of mTORC2. To test this notion, we showed that the combination of PP242 with erlotinib, an EGFR small molecule inhibitor, blocked both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity. In addition, we showed that the combination treatment inhibited colony formation, blocked cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. A systemic administration of PP242 and erlotinib resulted in the progression suppression of colorectal carcinoma xenografts in mice. This study suggests that the combination of mTOR kinase and EGFR inhibitors may provide an effective treatment of colorectal carcinoma.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been reported that PI3K/AKT pathway is altered in various cancers and AKT isoforms specifically regulate cell growth and metastasis of cancer cells; AKT1, but not AKT2, reduces invasion of cancer cells but maintains cancer growth. We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2, that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells via AKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity. METHODS: Transduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression in various cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays can evaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473 residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in various human breast cancer tissues. RESULTS: We observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducing Raptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead to significant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breast cancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase, indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, the TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: TIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis and downregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2 pathway.",

The reciprocal relation that exists between the two activating phosphorylation sites of Akt, T308 and S473, and the two mTOR complexes, C1 and C2, forms the central controlling hub that regulates these cellular functions. In our previous review \"PI3Kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in cell cycle\" we discussed the reciprocal relation between mTORC1 and C2 complexes in regulating cell metabolism and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. We present in this article, a hypothesis that activation of Akt-T308 phosphorylation in the presence of high ATP:AMP ratio promotes the stability of its phosphorylations and activates mTORC1 and the energy consuming biosynthetic processes. Depletion of energy leads to inactivation of mTORC1, activation of AMPK, FoxO, and promotes constitution of mTORC2 that leads to phosphorylation of Akt S473. Akt can also be activated independent of PI3K; this appears to have an advantage under situations like dietary restrictions, where insulin/insulin growth factor signaling could be a casualty.",

            "abstract": "To select the appropriate patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), it is important to gain a better understanding of the intracellular pathways leading to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is a common problem in patients with lung cancer. We recently reported that mutant KRAS adenocarcinoma is resistant to gefitinib as a result of amphiregulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor overexpression. This resistance leads to inhibition of Ku70 acetylation, thus enhancing the BAX/Ku70 interaction and preventing apoptosis. Here, we determined the intracellular pathways involved in gefitinib resistance in lung cancers and explored the impact of their inhibition. We analyzed the activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway in lung tumors. The activation of AKT was associated with disease progression in tumors with wild-type EGFR from patients treated with gefitinib (phase II clinical trial IFCT0401). The administration of IGF1R-TKI or amphiregulin-directed shRNA decreased AKT signaling and restored gefitinib sensitivity in mutant KRAS cells. The combination of PI3K/AKT inhibition with gefitinib restored apoptosis via Ku70 downregulation and BAX release from Ku70. Deacetylase inhibitors, which decreased the BAX/Ku70 interaction, inhibited AKT signaling and induced gefitinib-dependent apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thus a major pathway contributing to gefitinib resistance in lung tumors with KRAS mutation, through the regulation of the BAX/Ku70 interaction. This finding suggests that combined treatments could improve the outcomes for this subset of lung cancer patients, who have a poor prognosis.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. miR‑653‑5p was previously reported to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of miR‑653‑5p in the progression of breast cancer has not been studied. In the present study, it was found that overexpression of miR‑653‑5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR‑653‑5p promoted cell apoptosis in breast cancer by regulating the Bcl‑2/Bax axis and caspase‑9 activation. Additionally, the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were also inhibited by miR‑653‑5p. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that miR‑653‑5p directly targeted mitogen‑activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) and negatively regulated its expression in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of MAPK6 could overcome the inhibitory effects of miR‑653‑5p on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer. In conclusion, this study suggested that miR‑653‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAPK6 in the progression of breast cancer, and it may be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although it is known that mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) functions upstream of Akt, the role of this protein kinase complex in cancer is not well understood. Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-κB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-κB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-κB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that EGFRvIII-activated mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance through Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. These results highlight the role of mTORC2 as an integrator of two canonical signaling networks that are commonly altered in cancer, EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and NF-κB. These results also validate the importance of mTORC2 as a cancer target and provide new insights into its role in mediating chemotherapy resistance, suggesting new treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "AIMS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown dramatic clinical benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance remains a serious problem in clinical practice. The present study analyzed mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between the EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines and investigated the feasibility of targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitor in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells. METHODS: We selected four different types of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells: PC9, PC9GR, H1650 and H1975 cells as models to detect mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences by western blot and Immunoprecipitation and evaluated the antiproliferative effect and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 by MTT method and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the present study, we observed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway in a basal state was highly activated in resistant cells. In vitro mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities assays showed that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity in the basal state. The ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 showed dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ku-0063794 at the IC50 concentration effectively inhibited both mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation levels; the latter is an mTORC1 substrate and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation which would be induced by rapamycin and resulted in partial inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation. We also observed that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant clinical NSCLC tumor specimens had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-mediated tumorigenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and correlated with unfavorable outcome in certain types of other cancers. However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL. METHODS: A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells. RESULTS: ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

In this study, we observed that epimagnolin, a natural compound abundantly found in Shin-Yi, suppressed cell proliferation by inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced G1/S cell-cycle phase transition in JB6 Cl41 cells. Interestingly, epimagnolin suppressed EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation strongly at Ser473 and weakly at Thr308 without alteration of phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), and RSK1, resulting in abrogation of the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 and p70S6K at Thr389. Moreover, we found that epimagnolin suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73, resulting in the inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation activity. Computational docking indicated that epimagnolin targeted an active pocket of the mTOR kinase domain by forming three hydrogen bonds and three hydrophobic interactions. The prediction was confirmed by using in vitro kinase and adenosine triphosphate-bead competition assays. The inhibition of mTOR kinase activity resulted in the suppression of anchorage-independent cell transformation. Importantly, epimagnolin efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth of H1650 rather than H460 lung cancer cells with dependency of total and phosphorylated protein levels of mTOR and Akt. Inhibitory signaling of epimagnolin on cell proliferation of lung cancer cells was observed mainly in mTOR-Akt-p70S6K and mTOR-Akt-GSK3β-AP-1, which was similar to that shown in JB6 Cl41 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that epimagnolin potentiates as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents by direct active pocket targeting of mTOR kinase, resulting in sensitizing cancer cells harboring enhanced phosphorylation of the mTORC2-Akt-p70S6k signaling pathway.",

In P2X7R knockout (KO) mice, prolonged astroglial HSP25 induction exerts 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1-mediated autophagic pathway independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity following KA injection. Sustained HSP25 expression also enhances AKT-serine (S) 473 phosphorylation leading to astroglial autophagy via glycogen synthase kinase-3β/bax interacting factor 1 signaling pathway. However, it is unanswered how P2X7R deletion induces AKT-S473 hyperphosphorylation during autophagic process in astrocytes. In the present study, we found that AKT-S473 phosphorylation was increased by enhancing activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), independent of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 activities in isolated astrocytes of P2X7R knockout (KO) mice following KA injection. In addition, HSP25 overexpression in P2X7R KO mice acted as a chaperone of AKT, which retained AKT-S473 phosphorylation by inhibiting the pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) 1- and 2-binding to AKT. Therefore, our findings suggest that P2X7R may be a fine-tuner of AKT-S473 activity during astroglial autophagy by regulating FAK phosphorylation and HSP25-mediated inhibition of PHLPP1/2-AKT binding following KA treatment.",

            "abstract": "Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.",

            "abstract": "Most of breast cancers are resistant to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors rapamycin and rapalogs. Recent studies indicate mTORC2 is emerging as a promising cancer therapeutic target. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of targeting mTORC1 with mTORC2 on a variety of breast cancer cell lines and xenograft. We demonstrated that inhibition of mTORC1/2 by mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242 and OSI-027 effectively suppress phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and breast cancer cell proliferation. Targeting of mTORC2 either by kinase inhibitors or rictor knockdown, but not inhibition of mTORC1 either by rapamycin or raptor knockdown promotes serum starvation- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, targeting of mTORC2 but not mTORC1 efficiently prevent breast cancer cell migration. Most importantly, in vivo administration of PP242 but not rapamycin as single agent effectively prevents breast tumor growth and induces apoptosis in xenograft. Our data suggest that agents that inhibit mTORC2 may have advantages over selective mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers. Given that mTOR kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials, this study provides a strong rationale for testing the use of mTOR kinase inhibitors or combination of mTOR kinase inhibitors and cisplatin in the clinic.",

Recent discoveries indicate that the complex crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and multiple interacting cell signaling cascades can further promote prostate cancer progression and influence the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PI3K-AKT-mTOR-targeted therapies being explored in the clinic, as well as standard treatment approaches such as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the full extent of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network during prostate tumorigenesis, invasive progression and disease recurrence remains to be determined. In this review, we outline the emerging diversity of the genetic alterations that lead to activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer, and discuss new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and several key interacting oncogenic signaling cascades that can cooperate to facilitate prostate cancer growth and drug-resistance, specifically the androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and WNT signaling cascades. Ultimately, deepening our understanding of the broader PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is crucial to aid patient stratification for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-directed therapies, and to discover new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer that improve patient outcome.",

            "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure and leads to a reduction in the survival rate of cancer patients. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are aberrantly activated in many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which may indicate an association with breast cancer chemoresistance. In this study, we generated a chemoresistant human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231/gemcitabine (simplified hereafter as \"231/Gem\"), from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry studies revealed that with the same treatment concentration of gemcitabine, 231/Gem cells displayed more robust resistance to gemcitabine, which was reflected by fewer apoptotic cells and enhanced percentage of S-phase cells. Through the use of inverted microscopy, Cell Counting Kit-8, and Transwell assays, we found that compared with parental 231 cells, 231/Gem cells displayed more morphologic projections, enhanced cell proliferative ability, and improved cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem in comparison to control cells. However, there was no change in the expression of Cyclin D1 and p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In culture, inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and mTOR, but not of MEK/MAPK, could reverse the enhanced proliferative ability of 231/Gem cells. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor decreased the expression levels of p-AKT, p-MEK, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K; however, treatments with either MEK/MAPK or mTOR inhibitor significantly increased p-AKT expression. Thus, our data suggest that gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells is mainly mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This occurs through elevated expression of p-AKT protein to promote cell proliferation and is negatively regulated by the MEK/MAPK and mTOR pathways.",

            "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) is frequently dysregulated in disorders of cell growth and survival, including a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. The pathway can be abnormally activated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as well as in some pediatric lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most commonly, this abnormal activation occurs as a consequence of constitutive activation of AKT, providing a compelling rationale to target this pathway in many of these conditions. A variety of agents, beginning with the rapamycin analogue (rapalog) sirolimus, have been used successfully to target this pathway in a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. Rapalogs demonstrate significant preclinical activity against ALL, which has led to a number of clinical trials. Moreover, rapalogs can synergize with a number of conventional cytotoxic agents and overcome pathways of chemotherapeutic resistance for drugs commonly used in ALL treatment, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Based on preclinical data, rapalogs are also being studied in AML, CML, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently, significant progress has been made using rapalogs to treat pre-malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, including the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS); complete remissions in children with otherwise therapy-resistant disease have been seen. Rapalogs only block one component of the pathway (mTORC1), and newer agents are under preclinical and clinical development that can target different and often multiple protein kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Most of these agents have been tolerated in early-phase clinical trials. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under investigation. Of note, most of these also target other protein kinases. Newer agents are under development that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTORC1 and PI3K, and the triad of PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2. Preclinical data suggest these dual- and multi-kinase inhibitors are more potent than rapalogs against many of the aforementioned hematologic malignancies. Two classes of AKT inhibitors are under development, the alkyl-lysophospholipids (APLs) and small molecule AKT inhibitors. Both classes have agents currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development that target other components of the pathway, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E (eIF4E) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Finally, a number of other key signaling pathways interact with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, including Notch, MNK, Syk, MAPK, and aurora kinase. These alternative pathways are being targeted alone and in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with promising preclinical results in pediatric hematologic malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in pediatric hematologic malignancies, the agents that are used to target this pathway, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, using those agents in childhood hematologic cancers.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tetrameric α(2)-macroglobulin (α(2)M), a plasma panproteinase inhibitor, is activated upon interaction with a proteinase, and undergoes a major conformational change exposing a receptor recognition site in each of its subunits. Activated α(2)M (α(2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of α(2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies. RESULTS: Stimulation of cells with α(2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. α(2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced α(2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. α(2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces α(2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates. CONCLUSION: Binding of α(2)M* to prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 upregulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and promotes protein synthesis in the prostate cancer cells.",

            "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of various cellular responses by forming two functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). mTOR inhibitors have been used in attempts to treat these lesions, and prolonged progression free survival has been recorded. If this holds true also for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associated PNETs is yet unclear. We investigated the relationship between expression of the MEN1 protein menin and mTOR signaling in the presence or absence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. METHODS: In addition to use of menin wild type and menin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), menin was silenced by siRNA in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell line BON-1. Panels of protein phosphorylation, as activation markers downstream of PI3k-mTOR-Akt pathways, as well as menin expression were evaluated by immunoblotting. The impact of menin expression in the presence and absence of rapamycin was determinate upon Wound healing, migration and proliferation in MEFs and BON1 cells. RESULTS: PDGF-BB markedly increased phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrate Akt, at serine 473 (S473) and threonine 450 (T450) in menin-/- MEFs but did not alter phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates ribosomal protein S6 or eIF4B. Acute rapamycin treatment by mTORC1-S6 inhibition caused a greater enhancement of Akt phosphorylation on S473 in menin-/- cells as compared to menin+/+ MEFs (116% vs 38%). Chronic rapamycin treatment, which inhibits both mTORC1and 2, reduced Akt phosphorylation of S473 to a lesser extent in menin-/- MEFs than menin+/+ MEFs (25% vs 75%). Silencing of menin expression in human PNET cell line (BON1) also enhanced Akt phosphorylation at S473, but not activation of mTORC1. Interestingly, silencing menin in BON1 cells elevated S473 phosphorylation of Akt in both acute and chronic treatments with rapamycin. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on serum mediated wound healing and cell migration is impaired in menin-/- MEFs, as well as in menin-silenced BON1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Menin is involved in regulatory mechanism between the two mTOR complexes, and its reduced expression is accompanied with increased mTORC2-Akt signaling, which consequently impairs anti-migratory effect of rapamycin.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular processes important for progression of human cancer. RAD001 (everolimus), an mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor) inhibitor, has broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and cancer patients. Although most tumor lines are RAD001 sensitive, some are not. Selective mTORC1 inhibition can elicit increased AKT S473 phosphorylation, involving insulin receptor substrate 1, which is suggested to potentially attenuate effects on tumor cell proliferation and viability. Rictor may also play a role because rictor kinase complexes (including mTOR/rictor) regulate AKT S473 phosphorylation. The role of raptor and rictor in the in vitro response of human cancer cells to RAD001 was investigated. Using a large panel of cell lines representing different tumor histotypes, the basal phosphorylation of AKT S473 and some AKT substrates was found to correlate with the antiproliferative response to RAD001. In contrast, increased AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by RAD001 did not correlate. Similar increases in AKT phosphorylation occurred following raptor depletion using siRNA. Strikingly, rictor down-regulation attenuated AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition. Further analyses showed no relationship between modulation of AKT phosphorylation on S473 and T308 and AKT substrate phosphorylation patterns. Using a dual pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR catalytic inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235), currently in phase I trials, concomitant targeting of these kinases inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation, eliciting more profound cellular responses than mTORC1 inhibition alone. However, reduced cell viability could not be predicted from biochemical or cellular responses to mTORC1 inhibitors. These data could have implications for the clinical application of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: mTOR kinase inhibitors block mTORC1 and mTORC2 and thus do not cause the mTORC2 activation of AKT observed with rapamycin. We now show, however, that these drugs have a biphasic effect on AKT. Inhibition of mTORC2 leads to AKT serine 473 (S473) dephosphorylation and a rapid but transient inhibition of AKT T308 phosphorylation and AKT signaling. However, inhibition of mTOR kinase also relieves feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to subsequent phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation and rephosphorylation of AKT T308 sufficient to reactivate AKT activity and signaling. Thus, catalytic inhibition of mTOR kinase leads to a new steady state characterized by profound suppression of mTORC1 and accumulation of activated AKT phosphorylated on T308, but not S473. Combined inhibition of mTOR kinase and the induced RTKs fully abolishes AKT signaling and results in substantial cell death and tumor regression in vivo. These findings reveal the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks and the limitations of monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks, as AKT signaling becomes reactivated through a feedback-induced AKT species phosphorylated on T308 but lacking S473. The addition of RTK inhibitors can prevent this reactivation of AKT signaling and cause profound cell death and tumor regression in vivo, highlighting the possible need for combinatorial approaches to block feedback-regulated pathways.",

            "abstract": "The signaling pathways that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) use to activate Akt in ovarian cancer cells are investigated here. We show for the first time, with the use of both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, that the kinase activity and S473 phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA and S1P requires both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase, and MEK is likely to be upstream of p38, in HEY ovarian cancer cells. The requirement for both MEK and p38 is cell type- and stimulus-specific. Among 12 cell lines that we tested, 11 respond to LPA and S1P and all of the responsive cell lines require p38 but only nine of them require MEK. Among different stimuli tested, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates S473 phosphorylation of Akt in a MEK- and p38-dependent manner. However, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and endothelin-1-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation require p38 but not MEK. Insulin, on the other hand, stimulates Akt S473 phosphorylation independent of both MEK and p38 in HEY cells. T308 phosphorylation stimulated by LPA/S1P requires MEK but not p38 activation. MEK and p38 activation were sufficient for Akt S473 but not T308 phosphorylation in HEY cells. In contrast to S1P and PDGF, LPA requires Rho for Akt S473 phosphorylation, and Rho is upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). LPA/S1P-induced Akt activation may be involved in cell survival, because LPA and S1P treatment in HEY ovarian cancer cells results in a decrease in paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 activity in a PI3-K/MEK/p38-dependent manner.",

            "abstract": "Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.",

            "abstract": "MAPK4 is an atypical MAPK. Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.",

The second generation of mTOR inhibitors such as PP242 targets mTOR kinase; thus, they are capable of inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2. To examine the therapeutic potential of the mTOR kinase inhibitors, we treated a panel of colorectal carcinoma cell lines with PP242. Western blotting showed that the PP242 inhibition of mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation at Ser 473 (AKT(S473)) was transient only in the first few hours of the PP242 treatment. Receptor tyrosine kinase arrays further revealed that PP242 treatment increased the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Tyr 1068 (EGFR(T1068)). The parallel increase of AKT(S473) and EGFR(T1068) in the cells following PP242 treatment raised the possibility that EGFR phosphorylation might contribute to the PP242 incomplete inhibition of mTORC2. To test this notion, we showed that the combination of PP242 with erlotinib, an EGFR small molecule inhibitor, blocked both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity. In addition, we showed that the combination treatment inhibited colony formation, blocked cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. A systemic administration of PP242 and erlotinib resulted in the progression suppression of colorectal carcinoma xenografts in mice. This study suggests that the combination of mTOR kinase and EGFR inhibitors may provide an effective treatment of colorectal carcinoma.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of various cellular responses by forming two functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). mTOR inhibitors have been used in attempts to treat these lesions, and prolonged progression free survival has been recorded. If this holds true also for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associated PNETs is yet unclear. We investigated the relationship between expression of the MEN1 protein menin and mTOR signaling in the presence or absence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. METHODS: In addition to use of menin wild type and menin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), menin was silenced by siRNA in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell line BON-1. Panels of protein phosphorylation, as activation markers downstream of PI3k-mTOR-Akt pathways, as well as menin expression were evaluated by immunoblotting. The impact of menin expression in the presence and absence of rapamycin was determinate upon Wound healing, migration and proliferation in MEFs and BON1 cells. RESULTS: PDGF-BB markedly increased phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrate Akt, at serine 473 (S473) and threonine 450 (T450) in menin-/- MEFs but did not alter phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates ribosomal protein S6 or eIF4B. Acute rapamycin treatment by mTORC1-S6 inhibition caused a greater enhancement of Akt phosphorylation on S473 in menin-/- cells as compared to menin+/+ MEFs (116% vs 38%). Chronic rapamycin treatment, which inhibits both mTORC1and 2, reduced Akt phosphorylation of S473 to a lesser extent in menin-/- MEFs than menin+/+ MEFs (25% vs 75%). Silencing of menin expression in human PNET cell line (BON1) also enhanced Akt phosphorylation at S473, but not activation of mTORC1. Interestingly, silencing menin in BON1 cells elevated S473 phosphorylation of Akt in both acute and chronic treatments with rapamycin. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on serum mediated wound healing and cell migration is impaired in menin-/- MEFs, as well as in menin-silenced BON1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Menin is involved in regulatory mechanism between the two mTOR complexes, and its reduced expression is accompanied with increased mTORC2-Akt signaling, which consequently impairs anti-migratory effect of rapamycin.",

These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.",

ChK also has been shown to downregulate two important kinases involved in oncogenic pathways, Akt and JNK. This report investigates how ChK is involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (RTK/PI3K/mTORC2/Akt) to the centrally located protein kinase, Akt. Studies have reported that ChK does not inhibit PI3K comparable to wortmannin and does not affect PDK1 activation. PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylation on Akt T308, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt S473. Yet, Akt's two activation sites, T308 and S473, are known to be affected by ChK treatment. It was our hypothesis that ChK acts on the mTORC2 complex to inhibit the phosphorylation seen at Akt S473. This inhibition at mTORC2 should decrease phosphorylation at both these proteins, Akt and mTORC2 complex, compared to a known mTOR specific inhibitor, Torin1. Human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and H2009 cells were treated with IGF-1 or calyculin A to increase phosphorylation at complex mTORC2 and Akt. Pretreatment with ChK was able to significantly decrease phosphorylation at Akt S473 similarly to Torin1 with either IGF-1 or calyculin A treatment. Moreover, the autophosphorylation site on complex mTORC2, S2481, was also significantly reduced with ChK pretreatment, similar to Torin1. This is the first report to illustrate that ChK has a significant effect at mTORC2 S2481 and Akt S473 comparable to Torin1, indicating that it may be a mTOR inhibitor.",

Recent studies indicate mTORC2 is emerging as a promising cancer therapeutic target. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of targeting mTORC1 with mTORC2 on a variety of breast cancer cell lines and xenograft. We demonstrated that inhibition of mTORC1/2 by mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242 and OSI-027 effectively suppress phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and breast cancer cell proliferation. Targeting of mTORC2 either by kinase inhibitors or rictor knockdown, but not inhibition of mTORC1 either by rapamycin or raptor knockdown promotes serum starvation- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, targeting of mTORC2 but not mTORC1 efficiently prevent breast cancer cell migration. Most importantly, in vivo administration of PP242 but not rapamycin as single agent effectively prevents breast tumor growth and induces apoptosis in xenograft. Our data suggest that agents that inhibit mTORC2 may have advantages over selective mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers. Given that mTOR kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials, this study provides a strong rationale for testing the use of mTOR kinase inhibitors or combination of mTOR kinase inhibitors and cisplatin in the clinic.",

            "abstract": "To select the appropriate patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), it is important to gain a better understanding of the intracellular pathways leading to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is a common problem in patients with lung cancer. We recently reported that mutant KRAS adenocarcinoma is resistant to gefitinib as a result of amphiregulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor overexpression. This resistance leads to inhibition of Ku70 acetylation, thus enhancing the BAX/Ku70 interaction and preventing apoptosis. Here, we determined the intracellular pathways involved in gefitinib resistance in lung cancers and explored the impact of their inhibition. We analyzed the activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway in lung tumors. The activation of AKT was associated with disease progression in tumors with wild-type EGFR from patients treated with gefitinib (phase II clinical trial IFCT0401). The administration of IGF1R-TKI or amphiregulin-directed shRNA decreased AKT signaling and restored gefitinib sensitivity in mutant KRAS cells. The combination of PI3K/AKT inhibition with gefitinib restored apoptosis via Ku70 downregulation and BAX release from Ku70. Deacetylase inhibitors, which decreased the BAX/Ku70 interaction, inhibited AKT signaling and induced gefitinib-dependent apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thus a major pathway contributing to gefitinib resistance in lung tumors with KRAS mutation, through the regulation of the BAX/Ku70 interaction. This finding suggests that combined treatments could improve the outcomes for this subset of lung cancer patients, who have a poor prognosis.",

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are aberrantly activated in many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which may indicate an association with breast cancer chemoresistance. In this study, we generated a chemoresistant human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231/gemcitabine (simplified hereafter as \"231/Gem\"), from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry studies revealed that with the same treatment concentration of gemcitabine, 231/Gem cells displayed more robust resistance to gemcitabine, which was reflected by fewer apoptotic cells and enhanced percentage of S-phase cells. Through the use of inverted microscopy, Cell Counting Kit-8, and Transwell assays, we found that compared with parental 231 cells, 231/Gem cells displayed more morphologic projections, enhanced cell proliferative ability, and improved cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem in comparison to control cells. However, there was no change in the expression of Cyclin D1 and p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In culture, inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and mTOR, but not of MEK/MAPK, could reverse the enhanced proliferative ability of 231/Gem cells. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor decreased the expression levels of p-AKT, p-MEK, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K; however, treatments with either MEK/MAPK or mTOR inhibitor significantly increased p-AKT expression. Thus, our data suggest that gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells is mainly mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This occurs through elevated expression of p-AKT protein to promote cell proliferation and is negatively regulated by the MEK/MAPK and mTOR pathways.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activated B-Raf alone cannot induce melanoma but must cooperate with other signaling pathways. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathways are critical for tumorigenesis. The authors investigated the role of these pathways in uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: The effects of PI3K and mTOR activation and inhibition on the proliferation of human uveal melanoma cell lines expressing either activated (WT)B-Raf or (V600E)B-Raf were investigated. Interactions among PI3K, mTOR, and B-Raf/ERK were studied. RESULTS: Inhibition of PI3K deactivated P70S6 kinase, reduced cell proliferation by 71% to 84%, and increased apoptosis by a factor of 5.0 to 8.4 without reducing ERK1/2 activation, indicating that ERK plays no role in mediating PI3K in these processes. In contrast, rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR did not significantly affect cell proliferation because it simultaneously stimulated PI3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 expression. Regardless of B-Raf mutation status, cotreatment with the PI3K inhibitor effectively sensitized all melanoma cell lines to the B-Raf or ERK1/2 inhibition-induced reduction of cell proliferation. B-Raf/ERK and PI3K signaling, but not mTOR signaling, converged to control cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, p70S6K required the activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K interact with B-Raf/ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Activated PI3K/Akt attenuates the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on cell proliferation and thus serves as a negative feedback mechanism. This finding suggests that rapamycin is unlikely to inhibit uveal melanoma growth. In contrast, targeting PI3K while inhibiting B-Raf/ERK may be a promising approach to reduce the proliferation of uveal melanoma cells.",

Recent discoveries indicate that the complex crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and multiple interacting cell signaling cascades can further promote prostate cancer progression and influence the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PI3K-AKT-mTOR-targeted therapies being explored in the clinic, as well as standard treatment approaches such as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the full extent of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network during prostate tumorigenesis, invasive progression and disease recurrence remains to be determined. In this review, we outline the emerging diversity of the genetic alterations that lead to activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer, and discuss new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and several key interacting oncogenic signaling cascades that can cooperate to facilitate prostate cancer growth and drug-resistance, specifically the androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and WNT signaling cascades. Ultimately, deepening our understanding of the broader PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is crucial to aid patient stratification for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-directed therapies, and to discover new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer that improve patient outcome.",

In this study, we observed that epimagnolin, a natural compound abundantly found in Shin-Yi, suppressed cell proliferation by inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced G1/S cell-cycle phase transition in JB6 Cl41 cells. Interestingly, epimagnolin suppressed EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation strongly at Ser473 and weakly at Thr308 without alteration of phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), and RSK1, resulting in abrogation of the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 and p70S6K at Thr389. Moreover, we found that epimagnolin suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73, resulting in the inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation activity. Computational docking indicated that epimagnolin targeted an active pocket of the mTOR kinase domain by forming three hydrogen bonds and three hydrophobic interactions. The prediction was confirmed by using in vitro kinase and adenosine triphosphate-bead competition assays. The inhibition of mTOR kinase activity resulted in the suppression of anchorage-independent cell transformation. Importantly, epimagnolin efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth of H1650 rather than H460 lung cancer cells with dependency of total and phosphorylated protein levels of mTOR and Akt. Inhibitory signaling of epimagnolin on cell proliferation of lung cancer cells was observed mainly in mTOR-Akt-p70S6K and mTOR-Akt-GSK3β-AP-1, which was similar to that shown in JB6 Cl41 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that epimagnolin potentiates as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents by direct active pocket targeting of mTOR kinase, resulting in sensitizing cancer cells harboring enhanced phosphorylation of the mTORC2-Akt-p70S6k signaling pathway.",

Activated α(2)M (α(2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of α(2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies. RESULTS: Stimulation of cells with α(2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. α(2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced α(2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. α(2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces α(2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates. CONCLUSION: Binding of α(2)M* to prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 upregulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and promotes protein synthesis in the prostate cancer cells.",

Therefore, currently, we focused on the biological and clinical significance of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and hsa-mir-98-5p in NSCLC. It was observed that NEAT1 was upregulated while hsa-mir-98-5p was downregulated respectively in NSCLC cell lines compared to human normal lung epithelial BES-2B cells. Inhibition of NEAT1 can suppress the progression of NSCLC cells and hsa-mir-98-5p can reverse this phenomenon. Bioinformatics search was used to elucidate the correlation between NEAT1 and hsa-mir-98-5p. Additionally, a novel messenger RNA target of hsa-mir-98-5p, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), was predicted. Overexpression and knockdown studies were conducted to verify whether NEAT1 exhibits its biological functions through regulating hsa-mir-98-5p and MAPK6 in vitro. NEAT1 was able to increase MAPK6 expression and hsa-mir-98-5p mimics can inhibit MAPK6 via downregulating NEAT1 levels. We speculated that NEAT1 may act as a competing endogenous lncRNA to upregulate MAPK6 by attaching hsa-mir-98-5p in lung cancers. Taken these together, NEAT1/hsa-mir-98-5p/MAPK6 is involved in the development and progress in NSCLC. NEAT1 could be recommended as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic indicator in NSCLC diagnosis and treatment.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-mediated tumorigenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and correlated with unfavorable outcome in certain types of other cancers. However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL. METHODS: A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells. RESULTS: ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-κB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-κB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-κB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that EGFRvIII-activated mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance through Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. These results highlight the role of mTORC2 as an integrator of two canonical signaling networks that are commonly altered in cancer, EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and NF-κB. These results also validate the importance of mTORC2 as a cancer target and provide new insights into its role in mediating chemotherapy resistance, suggesting new treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The importance of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling complex in tumor progression is becoming increasingly recognized. HER2-amplified breast cancers use Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to drive tumor formation, tumor cell survival and resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. Cell motility, a key step in the metastatic process, can be activated by mTORC2 in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, but its role in promoting metastases from HER2-amplified breast cancers is not yet clear. METHODS: Because Rictor is an obligate cofactor of mTORC2, we genetically engineered Rictor ablation or overexpression in mouse and human HER2-amplified breast cancer models for modulation of mTORC2 activity. Signaling through mTORC2-dependent pathways was also manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, Akt, and Rac. Signaling was assessed by western analysis and biochemical pull-down assays specific for Rac-GTP and for active Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Metastases were assessed from spontaneous tumors and from intravenously delivered tumor cells. Motility and invasion of cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays. RESULTS: We found that Rictor ablation potently impaired, while Rictor overexpression increased, metastasis in spontaneous and intravenously seeded models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Additionally, migration and invasion of HER2-amplified human breast cancer cells was diminished in the absence of Rictor, or upon pharmacological mTOR kinase inhibition. Active Rac1 was required for Rictor-dependent invasion and motility, which rescued invasion/motility in Rictor depleted cells. Rictor/mTORC2-dependent dampening of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor RhoGDI2, a factor that correlated directly with increased overall survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer patients, promoted Rac1 activity and tumor cell invasion/migration. The mTORC2 substrate Akt did not affect RhoGDI2 dampening, but partially increased Rac1 activity through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, thus partially rescuing cell invasion/motility. The mTORC2 effector protein kinase C (PKC)α did rescue Rictor-mediated RhoGDI2 downregulation, partially rescuing Rac-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and migration/motility. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mTORC2 uses two coordinated pathways to activate cell invasion/motility, both of which converge on Rac1. Akt signaling activates Rac1 through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, while PKC signaling dampens expression of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor, RhoGDI2.",

            "abstract": "HER2 overexpression drives Akt signaling and cell survival and HER2-enriched breast tumors have a poor outcome when Akt is upregulated. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at T308 via PI3K and S473 via mTORC2. The importance of PI3K-activated Akt signaling is well documented in HER2-amplified breast cancer models, but the significance of mTORC2-activated Akt signaling in this setting remains uncertain. We report here that the mTORC2 obligate cofactor Rictor is enriched in HER2-amplified samples, correlating with increased phosphorylation at S473 on Akt. In invasive breast cancer specimens, Rictor expression was upregulated significantly compared with nonmalignant tissues. In a HER2/Neu mouse model of breast cancer, genetic ablation of Rictor decreased cell survival and phosphorylation at S473 on Akt, delaying tumor latency, penetrance, and burden. In HER2-amplified cells, exposure to an mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor decreased Akt-dependent cell survival, including in cells resistant to lapatinib, where cytotoxicity could be restored. We replicated these findings by silencing Rictor in breast cancer cell lines, but not silencing the mTORC1 cofactor Raptor (RPTOR). Taken together, our findings establish that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling drives Akt-dependent tumor progression in HER2-amplified breast cancers, rationalizing clinical investigation of dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitors and developing mTORC2-specific inhibitors for use in this setting.

In part, this results from activation of adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cAMP. We have previously employed the cAMP analog 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP to probe these responses. Here we show in 1-LN prostate cancer cells that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP causes a dose-dependent increase in Epac1, p-Akt(T308) , p-Akt(S473) , but not p-CREB. By contrast, the PKA activator 6-Benz-cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in p-CREB, but not Epac1. We measured mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation at S473 in immunoprecipitates of mTOR or Rictor from 1-LN cells. 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP caused a two-threefold increase in p-Akt(S473) and Akt(S473) kinase activity in Rictor immunoprecipitates. By contrast, there was only a negligible effect on p-Akt(T308) in Rictor immunoprecipitates. Silencing Rictor gene expression by RNAi significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) . These studies represent the first report that Epac1 mediates mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt(S473) . Pretreatment of these cells with the PI 3-Kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-dependent p-Akt(S473) and p-Akt(S473) kinase activities, and both effects were rapamycin insensitive. This treatment caused a two to threefold increase in S6 Kinase and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, indices of mTORC1 activation. Pretreatment of the cells with LY294002 and rapamycin significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. We further demonstrate that in 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-treated cells, Epac1 co-immunoprecipitates with AKAP, Raptor, Rictor, PDE3B, and PDE4D suggesting thereby that during Epac1-induced activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, Epac1 may have an additional function as a \"scaffold\" protein.",

            "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) is frequently dysregulated in disorders of cell growth and survival, including a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. The pathway can be abnormally activated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as well as in some pediatric lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most commonly, this abnormal activation occurs as a consequence of constitutive activation of AKT, providing a compelling rationale to target this pathway in many of these conditions. A variety of agents, beginning with the rapamycin analogue (rapalog) sirolimus, have been used successfully to target this pathway in a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. Rapalogs demonstrate significant preclinical activity against ALL, which has led to a number of clinical trials. Moreover, rapalogs can synergize with a number of conventional cytotoxic agents and overcome pathways of chemotherapeutic resistance for drugs commonly used in ALL treatment, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Based on preclinical data, rapalogs are also being studied in AML, CML, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently, significant progress has been made using rapalogs to treat pre-malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, including the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS); complete remissions in children with otherwise therapy-resistant disease have been seen. Rapalogs only block one component of the pathway (mTORC1), and newer agents are under preclinical and clinical development that can target different and often multiple protein kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Most of these agents have been tolerated in early-phase clinical trials. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under investigation. Of note, most of these also target other protein kinases. Newer agents are under development that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTORC1 and PI3K, and the triad of PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2. Preclinical data suggest these dual- and multi-kinase inhibitors are more potent than rapalogs against many of the aforementioned hematologic malignancies. Two classes of AKT inhibitors are under development, the alkyl-lysophospholipids (APLs) and small molecule AKT inhibitors. Both classes have agents currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development that target other components of the pathway, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E (eIF4E) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Finally, a number of other key signaling pathways interact with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, including Notch, MNK, Syk, MAPK, and aurora kinase. These alternative pathways are being targeted alone and in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with promising preclinical results in pediatric hematologic malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in pediatric hematologic malignancies, the agents that are used to target this pathway, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, using those agents in childhood hematologic cancers.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular processes important for progression of human cancer. RAD001 (everolimus), an mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor) inhibitor, has broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and cancer patients. Although most tumor lines are RAD001 sensitive, some are not. Selective mTORC1 inhibition can elicit increased AKT S473 phosphorylation, involving insulin receptor substrate 1, which is suggested to potentially attenuate effects on tumor cell proliferation and viability. Rictor may also play a role because rictor kinase complexes (including mTOR/rictor) regulate AKT S473 phosphorylation. The role of raptor and rictor in the in vitro response of human cancer cells to RAD001 was investigated. Using a large panel of cell lines representing different tumor histotypes, the basal phosphorylation of AKT S473 and some AKT substrates was found to correlate with the antiproliferative response to RAD001. In contrast, increased AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by RAD001 did not correlate. Similar increases in AKT phosphorylation occurred following raptor depletion using siRNA. Strikingly, rictor down-regulation attenuated AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition. Further analyses showed no relationship between modulation of AKT phosphorylation on S473 and T308 and AKT substrate phosphorylation patterns. Using a dual pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR catalytic inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235), currently in phase I trials, concomitant targeting of these kinases inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation, eliciting more profound cellular responses than mTORC1 inhibition alone. However, reduced cell viability could not be predicted from biochemical or cellular responses to mTORC1 inhibitors. These data could have implications for the clinical application of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been reported that PI3K/AKT pathway is altered in various cancers and AKT isoforms specifically regulate cell growth and metastasis of cancer cells; AKT1, but not AKT2, reduces invasion of cancer cells but maintains cancer growth. We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2, that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells via AKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity. METHODS: Transduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression in various cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays can evaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473 residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in various human breast cancer tissues. RESULTS: We observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducing Raptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead to significant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breast cancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase, indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, the TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: TIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis and downregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2 pathway.",

            "abstract": "AIMS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown dramatic clinical benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance remains a serious problem in clinical practice. The present study analyzed mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between the EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines and investigated the feasibility of targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitor in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells. METHODS: We selected four different types of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells: PC9, PC9GR, H1650 and H1975 cells as models to detect mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences by western blot and Immunoprecipitation and evaluated the antiproliferative effect and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 by MTT method and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the present study, we observed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway in a basal state was highly activated in resistant cells. In vitro mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities assays showed that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity in the basal state. The ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 showed dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ku-0063794 at the IC50 concentration effectively inhibited both mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation levels; the latter is an mTORC1 substrate and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation which would be induced by rapamycin and resulted in partial inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation. We also observed that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant clinical NSCLC tumor specimens had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: mTOR kinase inhibitors block mTORC1 and mTORC2 and thus do not cause the mTORC2 activation of AKT observed with rapamycin. We now show, however, that these drugs have a biphasic effect on AKT. Inhibition of mTORC2 leads to AKT serine 473 (S473) dephosphorylation and a rapid but transient inhibition of AKT T308 phosphorylation and AKT signaling. However, inhibition of mTOR kinase also relieves feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to subsequent phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation and rephosphorylation of AKT T308 sufficient to reactivate AKT activity and signaling. Thus, catalytic inhibition of mTOR kinase leads to a new steady state characterized by profound suppression of mTORC1 and accumulation of activated AKT phosphorylated on T308, but not S473. Combined inhibition of mTOR kinase and the induced RTKs fully abolishes AKT signaling and results in substantial cell death and tumor regression in vivo. These findings reveal the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks and the limitations of monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks, as AKT signaling becomes reactivated through a feedback-induced AKT species phosphorylated on T308 but lacking S473. The addition of RTK inhibitors can prevent this reactivation of AKT signaling and cause profound cell death and tumor regression in vivo, highlighting the possible need for combinatorial approaches to block feedback-regulated pathways.",

            "abstract": "Resistance of breast cancers to targeted hormone receptor (HR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors often occurs through dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase B/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway. Presently, no targeted therapies exist for breast cancers lacking HR and HER2 overexpression, many of which also exhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyper-activation. Resistance of breast cancers to current therapeutics also results, in part, from aberrant epigenetic modifications including protein acetylation regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show that the investigational drug MLN0128, which inhibits both complexes of mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2), and the hydroxamic acid pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA synergistically inhibit the viability of a phenotypically diverse panel of five breast cancer cell lines (HR-/+, HER2-/+). The combination of MLN0128 and TSA induces apoptosis in most breast cancer cell lines tested, but not in the non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. In parallel, the MLN0128/TSA combination reduces phosphorylation of AKT at S473 more than single agents alone and more so in the 5 malignant breast cancer cell lines than in the non-malignant mammary epithelial cells. Examining polysome profiles from one of the most sensitive breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3), we demonstrate that this MLN0128/TSA treatment combination synergistically impairs polysome assembly in conjunction with enhanced inhibition of 4eBP1 phosphorylation at S65. Taken together, these data indicate that the synergistic growth inhibiting consequence of combining a mTORC1/C2 inhibitor like MLN0128 with a pan-HDAC inhibitor like TSA results from their mechanistic convergence onto the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, profoundly inhibiting both AKT S473 and 4eBP1 S65 phosphorylation, reducing polysome formation and cancer cell viability.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we have reported that blockade/deletion of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated ion channel, exacerbates heat shock protein 25 (HSP25)-mediated astroglial autophagy (clasmatodendrosis) following kainic acid (KA) injection. In P2X7R knockout (KO) mice, prolonged astroglial HSP25 induction exerts 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1-mediated autophagic pathway independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity following KA injection. Sustained HSP25 expression also enhances AKT-serine (S) 473 phosphorylation leading to astroglial autophagy via glycogen synthase kinase-3β/bax interacting factor 1 signaling pathway. However, it is unanswered how P2X7R deletion induces AKT-S473 hyperphosphorylation during autophagic process in astrocytes. In the present study, we found that AKT-S473 phosphorylation was increased by enhancing activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), independent of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 activities in isolated astrocytes of P2X7R knockout (KO) mice following KA injection. In addition, HSP25 overexpression in P2X7R KO mice acted as a chaperone of AKT, which retained AKT-S473 phosphorylation by inhibiting the pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) 1- and 2-binding to AKT. Therefore, our findings suggest that P2X7R may be a fine-tuner of AKT-S473 activity during astroglial autophagy by regulating FAK phosphorylation and HSP25-mediated inhibition of PHLPP1/2-AKT binding following KA treatment.",

Previous analysis of mice with a targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter in the Mapk6 locus (Mapk6lacZ ) showed that inactivation of ERK3 in Mapk6lacZ mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with intrauterine growth restriction, defective lung maturation, and neuromuscular anomalies. To further explore the role of ERK3 in physiology and disease, we generated novel mouse models expressing a catalytically inactive (Mapk6KD ) or conditional (Mapk6Δ ) allele of ERK3. Surprisingly, we found that mice devoid of ERK3 kinase activity or expression survive the perinatal period without any observable lung or neuromuscular phenotype. ERK3 mutant mice reached adulthood, were fertile, and showed no apparent health problem. However, analysis of growth curves revealed that ERK3 kinase activity is necessary for optimal postnatal growth. To gain insight into the genetic basis underlying the discrepancy in phenotypes of different Mapk6 mutant mouse models, we analyzed the regulation of genes flanking the Mapk6 locus by quantitative PCR. We found that the expression of several Mapk6 neighboring genes is deregulated in Mapk6lacZ mice but not in Mapk6KD or Mapk6Δ mutant mice. Our genetic analysis suggests that off-target effects of the targeting construct on local gene expression are responsible for the perinatal lethality phenotype of Mapk6lacZ mutant mice.",

            "abstract": "The signaling pathways that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) use to activate Akt in ovarian cancer cells are investigated here. We show for the first time, with the use of both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, that the kinase activity and S473 phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA and S1P requires both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase, and MEK is likely to be upstream of p38, in HEY ovarian cancer cells. The requirement for both MEK and p38 is cell type- and stimulus-specific. Among 12 cell lines that we tested, 11 respond to LPA and S1P and all of the responsive cell lines require p38 but only nine of them require MEK. Among different stimuli tested, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates S473 phosphorylation of Akt in a MEK- and p38-dependent manner. However, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and endothelin-1-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation require p38 but not MEK. Insulin, on the other hand, stimulates Akt S473 phosphorylation independent of both MEK and p38 in HEY cells. T308 phosphorylation stimulated by LPA/S1P requires MEK but not p38 activation. MEK and p38 activation were sufficient for Akt S473 but not T308 phosphorylation in HEY cells. In contrast to S1P and PDGF, LPA requires Rho for Akt S473 phosphorylation, and Rho is upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). LPA/S1P-induced Akt activation may be involved in cell survival, because LPA and S1P treatment in HEY ovarian cancer cells results in a decrease in paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 activity in a PI3-K/MEK/p38-dependent manner.",

            "abstract": "The serine threonine protein kinase, Akt, is at the central hub of signaling pathways that regulates cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The reciprocal relation that exists between the two activating phosphorylation sites of Akt, T308 and S473, and the two mTOR complexes, C1 and C2, forms the central controlling hub that regulates these cellular functions. In our previous review \"PI3Kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in cell cycle\" we discussed the reciprocal relation between mTORC1 and C2 complexes in regulating cell metabolism and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. We present in this article, a hypothesis that activation of Akt-T308 phosphorylation in the presence of high ATP:AMP ratio promotes the stability of its phosphorylations and activates mTORC1 and the energy consuming biosynthetic processes. Depletion of energy leads to inactivation of mTORC1, activation of AMPK, FoxO, and promotes constitution of mTORC2 that leads to phosphorylation of Akt S473. Akt can also be activated independent of PI3K; this appears to have an advantage under situations like dietary restrictions, where insulin/insulin growth factor signaling could be a casualty.",

            "abstract": "Breast cancer is the worldwide leading cause of cancer‑related deaths among women. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. miR‑653‑5p was previously reported to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of miR‑653‑5p in the progression of breast cancer has not been studied. In the present study, it was found that overexpression of miR‑653‑5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR‑653‑5p promoted cell apoptosis in breast cancer by regulating the Bcl‑2/Bax axis and caspase‑9 activation. Additionally, the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were also inhibited by miR‑653‑5p. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that miR‑653‑5p directly targeted mitogen‑activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) and negatively regulated its expression in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of MAPK6 could overcome the inhibitory effects of miR‑653‑5p on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer. In conclusion, this study suggested that miR‑653‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAPK6 in the progression of breast cancer, and it may be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",

In part, this results from activation of adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cAMP. We have previously employed the cAMP analog 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP to probe these responses. Here we show in 1-LN prostate cancer cells that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP causes a dose-dependent increase in Epac1, p-Akt(T308) , p-Akt(S473) , but not p-CREB. By contrast, the PKA activator 6-Benz-cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in p-CREB, but not Epac1. We measured mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation at S473 in immunoprecipitates of mTOR or Rictor from 1-LN cells. 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP caused a two-threefold increase in p-Akt(S473) and Akt(S473) kinase activity in Rictor immunoprecipitates. By contrast, there was only a negligible effect on p-Akt(T308) in Rictor immunoprecipitates. Silencing Rictor gene expression by RNAi significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) . These studies represent the first report that Epac1 mediates mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt(S473) . Pretreatment of these cells with the PI 3-Kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-dependent p-Akt(S473) and p-Akt(S473) kinase activities, and both effects were rapamycin insensitive. This treatment caused a two to threefold increase in S6 Kinase and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, indices of mTORC1 activation. Pretreatment of the cells with LY294002 and rapamycin significantly suppressed 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. We further demonstrate that in 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-treated cells, Epac1 co-immunoprecipitates with AKAP, Raptor, Rictor, PDE3B, and PDE4D suggesting thereby that during Epac1-induced activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, Epac1 may have an additional function as a \"scaffold\" protein.",

            "abstract": "MAPK4 is an atypical MAPK. Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.",

            "abstract": "To select the appropriate patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), it is important to gain a better understanding of the intracellular pathways leading to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is a common problem in patients with lung cancer. We recently reported that mutant KRAS adenocarcinoma is resistant to gefitinib as a result of amphiregulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor overexpression. This resistance leads to inhibition of Ku70 acetylation, thus enhancing the BAX/Ku70 interaction and preventing apoptosis. Here, we determined the intracellular pathways involved in gefitinib resistance in lung cancers and explored the impact of their inhibition. We analyzed the activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway in lung tumors. The activation of AKT was associated with disease progression in tumors with wild-type EGFR from patients treated with gefitinib (phase II clinical trial IFCT0401). The administration of IGF1R-TKI or amphiregulin-directed shRNA decreased AKT signaling and restored gefitinib sensitivity in mutant KRAS cells. The combination of PI3K/AKT inhibition with gefitinib restored apoptosis via Ku70 downregulation and BAX release from Ku70. Deacetylase inhibitors, which decreased the BAX/Ku70 interaction, inhibited AKT signaling and induced gefitinib-dependent apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thus a major pathway contributing to gefitinib resistance in lung tumors with KRAS mutation, through the regulation of the BAX/Ku70 interaction. This finding suggests that combined treatments could improve the outcomes for this subset of lung cancer patients, who have a poor prognosis.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The importance of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling complex in tumor progression is becoming increasingly recognized. HER2-amplified breast cancers use Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to drive tumor formation, tumor cell survival and resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. Cell motility, a key step in the metastatic process, can be activated by mTORC2 in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, but its role in promoting metastases from HER2-amplified breast cancers is not yet clear. METHODS: Because Rictor is an obligate cofactor of mTORC2, we genetically engineered Rictor ablation or overexpression in mouse and human HER2-amplified breast cancer models for modulation of mTORC2 activity. Signaling through mTORC2-dependent pathways was also manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, Akt, and Rac. Signaling was assessed by western analysis and biochemical pull-down assays specific for Rac-GTP and for active Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Metastases were assessed from spontaneous tumors and from intravenously delivered tumor cells. Motility and invasion of cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays. RESULTS: We found that Rictor ablation potently impaired, while Rictor overexpression increased, metastasis in spontaneous and intravenously seeded models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Additionally, migration and invasion of HER2-amplified human breast cancer cells was diminished in the absence of Rictor, or upon pharmacological mTOR kinase inhibition. Active Rac1 was required for Rictor-dependent invasion and motility, which rescued invasion/motility in Rictor depleted cells. Rictor/mTORC2-dependent dampening of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor RhoGDI2, a factor that correlated directly with increased overall survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer patients, promoted Rac1 activity and tumor cell invasion/migration. The mTORC2 substrate Akt did not affect RhoGDI2 dampening, but partially increased Rac1 activity through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, thus partially rescuing cell invasion/motility. The mTORC2 effector protein kinase C (PKC)α did rescue Rictor-mediated RhoGDI2 downregulation, partially rescuing Rac-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and migration/motility. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mTORC2 uses two coordinated pathways to activate cell invasion/motility, both of which converge on Rac1. Akt signaling activates Rac1 through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, while PKC signaling dampens expression of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor, RhoGDI2.",

            "abstract": "The signaling pathways that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) use to activate Akt in ovarian cancer cells are investigated here. We show for the first time, with the use of both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, that the kinase activity and S473 phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA and S1P requires both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase, and MEK is likely to be upstream of p38, in HEY ovarian cancer cells. The requirement for both MEK and p38 is cell type- and stimulus-specific. Among 12 cell lines that we tested, 11 respond to LPA and S1P and all of the responsive cell lines require p38 but only nine of them require MEK. Among different stimuli tested, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates S473 phosphorylation of Akt in a MEK- and p38-dependent manner. However, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and endothelin-1-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation require p38 but not MEK. Insulin, on the other hand, stimulates Akt S473 phosphorylation independent of both MEK and p38 in HEY cells. T308 phosphorylation stimulated by LPA/S1P requires MEK but not p38 activation. MEK and p38 activation were sufficient for Akt S473 but not T308 phosphorylation in HEY cells. In contrast to S1P and PDGF, LPA requires Rho for Akt S473 phosphorylation, and Rho is upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). LPA/S1P-induced Akt activation may be involved in cell survival, because LPA and S1P treatment in HEY ovarian cancer cells results in a decrease in paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 activity in a PI3-K/MEK/p38-dependent manner.",

Therefore, currently, we focused on the biological and clinical significance of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and hsa-mir-98-5p in NSCLC. It was observed that NEAT1 was upregulated while hsa-mir-98-5p was downregulated respectively in NSCLC cell lines compared to human normal lung epithelial BES-2B cells. Inhibition of NEAT1 can suppress the progression of NSCLC cells and hsa-mir-98-5p can reverse this phenomenon. Bioinformatics search was used to elucidate the correlation between NEAT1 and hsa-mir-98-5p. Additionally, a novel messenger RNA target of hsa-mir-98-5p, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), was predicted. Overexpression and knockdown studies were conducted to verify whether NEAT1 exhibits its biological functions through regulating hsa-mir-98-5p and MAPK6 in vitro. NEAT1 was able to increase MAPK6 expression and hsa-mir-98-5p mimics can inhibit MAPK6 via downregulating NEAT1 levels. We speculated that NEAT1 may act as a competing endogenous lncRNA to upregulate MAPK6 by attaching hsa-mir-98-5p in lung cancers. Taken these together, NEAT1/hsa-mir-98-5p/MAPK6 is involved in the development and progress in NSCLC. NEAT1 could be recommended as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic indicator in NSCLC diagnosis and treatment.",

ChK also has been shown to downregulate two important kinases involved in oncogenic pathways, Akt and JNK. This report investigates how ChK is involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (RTK/PI3K/mTORC2/Akt) to the centrally located protein kinase, Akt. Studies have reported that ChK does not inhibit PI3K comparable to wortmannin and does not affect PDK1 activation. PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylation on Akt T308, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt S473. Yet, Akt's two activation sites, T308 and S473, are known to be affected by ChK treatment. It was our hypothesis that ChK acts on the mTORC2 complex to inhibit the phosphorylation seen at Akt S473. This inhibition at mTORC2 should decrease phosphorylation at both these proteins, Akt and mTORC2 complex, compared to a known mTOR specific inhibitor, Torin1. Human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and H2009 cells were treated with IGF-1 or calyculin A to increase phosphorylation at complex mTORC2 and Akt. Pretreatment with ChK was able to significantly decrease phosphorylation at Akt S473 similarly to Torin1 with either IGF-1 or calyculin A treatment. Moreover, the autophosphorylation site on complex mTORC2, S2481, was also significantly reduced with ChK pretreatment, similar to Torin1. This is the first report to illustrate that ChK has a significant effect at mTORC2 S2481 and Akt S473 comparable to Torin1, indicating that it may be a mTOR inhibitor.",

            "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) is frequently dysregulated in disorders of cell growth and survival, including a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. The pathway can be abnormally activated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as well as in some pediatric lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most commonly, this abnormal activation occurs as a consequence of constitutive activation of AKT, providing a compelling rationale to target this pathway in many of these conditions. A variety of agents, beginning with the rapamycin analogue (rapalog) sirolimus, have been used successfully to target this pathway in a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. Rapalogs demonstrate significant preclinical activity against ALL, which has led to a number of clinical trials. Moreover, rapalogs can synergize with a number of conventional cytotoxic agents and overcome pathways of chemotherapeutic resistance for drugs commonly used in ALL treatment, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Based on preclinical data, rapalogs are also being studied in AML, CML, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently, significant progress has been made using rapalogs to treat pre-malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, including the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS); complete remissions in children with otherwise therapy-resistant disease have been seen. Rapalogs only block one component of the pathway (mTORC1), and newer agents are under preclinical and clinical development that can target different and often multiple protein kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Most of these agents have been tolerated in early-phase clinical trials. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under investigation. Of note, most of these also target other protein kinases. Newer agents are under development that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTORC1 and PI3K, and the triad of PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2. Preclinical data suggest these dual- and multi-kinase inhibitors are more potent than rapalogs against many of the aforementioned hematologic malignancies. Two classes of AKT inhibitors are under development, the alkyl-lysophospholipids (APLs) and small molecule AKT inhibitors. Both classes have agents currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development that target other components of the pathway, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E (eIF4E) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Finally, a number of other key signaling pathways interact with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, including Notch, MNK, Syk, MAPK, and aurora kinase. These alternative pathways are being targeted alone and in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with promising preclinical results in pediatric hematologic malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in pediatric hematologic malignancies, the agents that are used to target this pathway, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, using those agents in childhood hematologic cancers.",

            "abstract": "The physiological functions of the atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) remain poorly characterized. Previous analysis of mice with a targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter in the Mapk6 locus (Mapk6lacZ ) showed that inactivation of ERK3 in Mapk6lacZ mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with intrauterine growth restriction, defective lung maturation, and neuromuscular anomalies. To further explore the role of ERK3 in physiology and disease, we generated novel mouse models expressing a catalytically inactive (Mapk6KD ) or conditional (Mapk6Δ ) allele of ERK3. Surprisingly, we found that mice devoid of ERK3 kinase activity or expression survive the perinatal period without any observable lung or neuromuscular phenotype. ERK3 mutant mice reached adulthood, were fertile, and showed no apparent health problem. However, analysis of growth curves revealed that ERK3 kinase activity is necessary for optimal postnatal growth. To gain insight into the genetic basis underlying the discrepancy in phenotypes of different Mapk6 mutant mouse models, we analyzed the regulation of genes flanking the Mapk6 locus by quantitative PCR. We found that the expression of several Mapk6 neighboring genes is deregulated in Mapk6lacZ mice but not in Mapk6KD or Mapk6Δ mutant mice. Our genetic analysis suggests that off-target effects of the targeting construct on local gene expression are responsible for the perinatal lethality phenotype of Mapk6lacZ mutant mice.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2) are overactive in colorectal carcinomas; however, the first generation of mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin have failed to show clinical benefits in treating colorectal carcinoma in part due to their effects only on mTORC1. The second generation of mTOR inhibitors such as PP242 targets mTOR kinase; thus, they are capable of inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2. To examine the therapeutic potential of the mTOR kinase inhibitors, we treated a panel of colorectal carcinoma cell lines with PP242. Western blotting showed that the PP242 inhibition of mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation at Ser 473 (AKT(S473)) was transient only in the first few hours of the PP242 treatment. Receptor tyrosine kinase arrays further revealed that PP242 treatment increased the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Tyr 1068 (EGFR(T1068)). The parallel increase of AKT(S473) and EGFR(T1068) in the cells following PP242 treatment raised the possibility that EGFR phosphorylation might contribute to the PP242 incomplete inhibition of mTORC2. To test this notion, we showed that the combination of PP242 with erlotinib, an EGFR small molecule inhibitor, blocked both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity. In addition, we showed that the combination treatment inhibited colony formation, blocked cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. A systemic administration of PP242 and erlotinib resulted in the progression suppression of colorectal carcinoma xenografts in mice. This study suggests that the combination of mTOR kinase and EGFR inhibitors may provide an effective treatment of colorectal carcinoma.",

In P2X7R knockout (KO) mice, prolonged astroglial HSP25 induction exerts 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1-mediated autophagic pathway independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity following KA injection. Sustained HSP25 expression also enhances AKT-serine (S) 473 phosphorylation leading to astroglial autophagy via glycogen synthase kinase-3β/bax interacting factor 1 signaling pathway. However, it is unanswered how P2X7R deletion induces AKT-S473 hyperphosphorylation during autophagic process in astrocytes. In the present study, we found that AKT-S473 phosphorylation was increased by enhancing activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), independent of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 activities in isolated astrocytes of P2X7R knockout (KO) mice following KA injection. In addition, HSP25 overexpression in P2X7R KO mice acted as a chaperone of AKT, which retained AKT-S473 phosphorylation by inhibiting the pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) 1- and 2-binding to AKT. Therefore, our findings suggest that P2X7R may be a fine-tuner of AKT-S473 activity during astroglial autophagy by regulating FAK phosphorylation and HSP25-mediated inhibition of PHLPP1/2-AKT binding following KA treatment.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been reported that PI3K/AKT pathway is altered in various cancers and AKT isoforms specifically regulate cell growth and metastasis of cancer cells; AKT1, but not AKT2, reduces invasion of cancer cells but maintains cancer growth. We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2, that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells via AKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity. METHODS: Transduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression in various cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays can evaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473 residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in various human breast cancer tissues. RESULTS: We observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducing Raptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead to significant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breast cancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase, indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, the TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: TIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis and downregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2 pathway.",

Recent discoveries indicate that the complex crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and multiple interacting cell signaling cascades can further promote prostate cancer progression and influence the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PI3K-AKT-mTOR-targeted therapies being explored in the clinic, as well as standard treatment approaches such as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the full extent of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network during prostate tumorigenesis, invasive progression and disease recurrence remains to be determined. In this review, we outline the emerging diversity of the genetic alterations that lead to activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer, and discuss new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and several key interacting oncogenic signaling cascades that can cooperate to facilitate prostate cancer growth and drug-resistance, specifically the androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and WNT signaling cascades. Ultimately, deepening our understanding of the broader PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is crucial to aid patient stratification for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-directed therapies, and to discover new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer that improve patient outcome.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of various cellular responses by forming two functional complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). mTOR inhibitors have been used in attempts to treat these lesions, and prolonged progression free survival has been recorded. If this holds true also for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associated PNETs is yet unclear. We investigated the relationship between expression of the MEN1 protein menin and mTOR signaling in the presence or absence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. METHODS: In addition to use of menin wild type and menin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), menin was silenced by siRNA in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell line BON-1. Panels of protein phosphorylation, as activation markers downstream of PI3k-mTOR-Akt pathways, as well as menin expression were evaluated by immunoblotting. The impact of menin expression in the presence and absence of rapamycin was determinate upon Wound healing, migration and proliferation in MEFs and BON1 cells. RESULTS: PDGF-BB markedly increased phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrate Akt, at serine 473 (S473) and threonine 450 (T450) in menin-/- MEFs but did not alter phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates ribosomal protein S6 or eIF4B. Acute rapamycin treatment by mTORC1-S6 inhibition caused a greater enhancement of Akt phosphorylation on S473 in menin-/- cells as compared to menin+/+ MEFs (116% vs 38%). Chronic rapamycin treatment, which inhibits both mTORC1and 2, reduced Akt phosphorylation of S473 to a lesser extent in menin-/- MEFs than menin+/+ MEFs (25% vs 75%). Silencing of menin expression in human PNET cell line (BON1) also enhanced Akt phosphorylation at S473, but not activation of mTORC1. Interestingly, silencing menin in BON1 cells elevated S473 phosphorylation of Akt in both acute and chronic treatments with rapamycin. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on serum mediated wound healing and cell migration is impaired in menin-/- MEFs, as well as in menin-silenced BON1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Menin is involved in regulatory mechanism between the two mTOR complexes, and its reduced expression is accompanied with increased mTORC2-Akt signaling, which consequently impairs anti-migratory effect of rapamycin.",

            "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activated B-Raf alone cannot induce melanoma but must cooperate with other signaling pathways. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathways are critical for tumorigenesis. The authors investigated the role of these pathways in uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: The effects of PI3K and mTOR activation and inhibition on the proliferation of human uveal melanoma cell lines expressing either activated (WT)B-Raf or (V600E)B-Raf were investigated. Interactions among PI3K, mTOR, and B-Raf/ERK were studied. RESULTS: Inhibition of PI3K deactivated P70S6 kinase, reduced cell proliferation by 71% to 84%, and increased apoptosis by a factor of 5.0 to 8.4 without reducing ERK1/2 activation, indicating that ERK plays no role in mediating PI3K in these processes. In contrast, rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR did not significantly affect cell proliferation because it simultaneously stimulated PI3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 expression. Regardless of B-Raf mutation status, cotreatment with the PI3K inhibitor effectively sensitized all melanoma cell lines to the B-Raf or ERK1/2 inhibition-induced reduction of cell proliferation. B-Raf/ERK and PI3K signaling, but not mTOR signaling, converged to control cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, p70S6K required the activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K interact with B-Raf/ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Activated PI3K/Akt attenuates the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on cell proliferation and thus serves as a negative feedback mechanism. This finding suggests that rapamycin is unlikely to inhibit uveal melanoma growth. In contrast, targeting PI3K while inhibiting B-Raf/ERK may be a promising approach to reduce the proliferation of uveal melanoma cells.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: mTOR kinase inhibitors block mTORC1 and mTORC2 and thus do not cause the mTORC2 activation of AKT observed with rapamycin. We now show, however, that these drugs have a biphasic effect on AKT. Inhibition of mTORC2 leads to AKT serine 473 (S473) dephosphorylation and a rapid but transient inhibition of AKT T308 phosphorylation and AKT signaling. However, inhibition of mTOR kinase also relieves feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to subsequent phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation and rephosphorylation of AKT T308 sufficient to reactivate AKT activity and signaling. Thus, catalytic inhibition of mTOR kinase leads to a new steady state characterized by profound suppression of mTORC1 and accumulation of activated AKT phosphorylated on T308, but not S473. Combined inhibition of mTOR kinase and the induced RTKs fully abolishes AKT signaling and results in substantial cell death and tumor regression in vivo. These findings reveal the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks and the limitations of monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show the adaptive capabilities of oncogenic signaling networks, as AKT signaling becomes reactivated through a feedback-induced AKT species phosphorylated on T308 but lacking S473. The addition of RTK inhibitors can prevent this reactivation of AKT signaling and cause profound cell death and tumor regression in vivo, highlighting the possible need for combinatorial approaches to block feedback-regulated pathways.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. miR‑653‑5p was previously reported to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of miR‑653‑5p in the progression of breast cancer has not been studied. In the present study, it was found that overexpression of miR‑653‑5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR‑653‑5p promoted cell apoptosis in breast cancer by regulating the Bcl‑2/Bax axis and caspase‑9 activation. Additionally, the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were also inhibited by miR‑653‑5p. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that miR‑653‑5p directly targeted mitogen‑activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) and negatively regulated its expression in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of MAPK6 could overcome the inhibitory effects of miR‑653‑5p on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer. In conclusion, this study suggested that miR‑653‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAPK6 in the progression of breast cancer, and it may be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",

            "abstract": "Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.",

Recent studies indicate mTORC2 is emerging as a promising cancer therapeutic target. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of targeting mTORC1 with mTORC2 on a variety of breast cancer cell lines and xenograft. We demonstrated that inhibition of mTORC1/2 by mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242 and OSI-027 effectively suppress phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and breast cancer cell proliferation. Targeting of mTORC2 either by kinase inhibitors or rictor knockdown, but not inhibition of mTORC1 either by rapamycin or raptor knockdown promotes serum starvation- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, targeting of mTORC2 but not mTORC1 efficiently prevent breast cancer cell migration. Most importantly, in vivo administration of PP242 but not rapamycin as single agent effectively prevents breast tumor growth and induces apoptosis in xenograft. Our data suggest that agents that inhibit mTORC2 may have advantages over selective mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers. Given that mTOR kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials, this study provides a strong rationale for testing the use of mTOR kinase inhibitors or combination of mTOR kinase inhibitors and cisplatin in the clinic.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-mediated tumorigenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and correlated with unfavorable outcome in certain types of other cancers. However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL. METHODS: A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells. RESULTS: ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although it is known that mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) functions upstream of Akt, the role of this protein kinase complex in cancer is not well understood. Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-κB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-κB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-κB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that EGFRvIII-activated mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance through Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. These results highlight the role of mTORC2 as an integrator of two canonical signaling networks that are commonly altered in cancer, EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and NF-κB. These results also validate the importance of mTORC2 as a cancer target and provide new insights into its role in mediating chemotherapy resistance, suggesting new treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "Resistance of breast cancers to targeted hormone receptor (HR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors often occurs through dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase B/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway. Presently, no targeted therapies exist for breast cancers lacking HR and HER2 overexpression, many of which also exhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyper-activation. Resistance of breast cancers to current therapeutics also results, in part, from aberrant epigenetic modifications including protein acetylation regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show that the investigational drug MLN0128, which inhibits both complexes of mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2), and the hydroxamic acid pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA synergistically inhibit the viability of a phenotypically diverse panel of five breast cancer cell lines (HR-/+, HER2-/+). The combination of MLN0128 and TSA induces apoptosis in most breast cancer cell lines tested, but not in the non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. In parallel, the MLN0128/TSA combination reduces phosphorylation of AKT at S473 more than single agents alone and more so in the 5 malignant breast cancer cell lines than in the non-malignant mammary epithelial cells. Examining polysome profiles from one of the most sensitive breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3), we demonstrate that this MLN0128/TSA treatment combination synergistically impairs polysome assembly in conjunction with enhanced inhibition of 4eBP1 phosphorylation at S65. Taken together, these data indicate that the synergistic growth inhibiting consequence of combining a mTORC1/C2 inhibitor like MLN0128 with a pan-HDAC inhibitor like TSA results from their mechanistic convergence onto the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, profoundly inhibiting both AKT S473 and 4eBP1 S65 phosphorylation, reducing polysome formation and cancer cell viability.",

            "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular processes important for progression of human cancer. RAD001 (everolimus), an mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor) inhibitor, has broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and cancer patients. Although most tumor lines are RAD001 sensitive, some are not. Selective mTORC1 inhibition can elicit increased AKT S473 phosphorylation, involving insulin receptor substrate 1, which is suggested to potentially attenuate effects on tumor cell proliferation and viability. Rictor may also play a role because rictor kinase complexes (including mTOR/rictor) regulate AKT S473 phosphorylation. The role of raptor and rictor in the in vitro response of human cancer cells to RAD001 was investigated. Using a large panel of cell lines representing different tumor histotypes, the basal phosphorylation of AKT S473 and some AKT substrates was found to correlate with the antiproliferative response to RAD001. In contrast, increased AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by RAD001 did not correlate. Similar increases in AKT phosphorylation occurred following raptor depletion using siRNA. Strikingly, rictor down-regulation attenuated AKT S473 phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition. Further analyses showed no relationship between modulation of AKT phosphorylation on S473 and T308 and AKT substrate phosphorylation patterns. Using a dual pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR catalytic inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235), currently in phase I trials, concomitant targeting of these kinases inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation, eliciting more profound cellular responses than mTORC1 inhibition alone. However, reduced cell viability could not be predicted from biochemical or cellular responses to mTORC1 inhibitors. These data could have implications for the clinical application of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "AIMS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown dramatic clinical benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance remains a serious problem in clinical practice. The present study analyzed mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between the EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines and investigated the feasibility of targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitor in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells. METHODS: We selected four different types of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells: PC9, PC9GR, H1650 and H1975 cells as models to detect mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences by western blot and Immunoprecipitation and evaluated the antiproliferative effect and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 by MTT method and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the present study, we observed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway in a basal state was highly activated in resistant cells. In vitro mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities assays showed that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity in the basal state. The ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 showed dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ku-0063794 at the IC50 concentration effectively inhibited both mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation levels; the latter is an mTORC1 substrate and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation which would be induced by rapamycin and resulted in partial inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation. We also observed that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant clinical NSCLC tumor specimens had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated.",

In this study, we observed that epimagnolin, a natural compound abundantly found in Shin-Yi, suppressed cell proliferation by inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced G1/S cell-cycle phase transition in JB6 Cl41 cells. Interestingly, epimagnolin suppressed EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation strongly at Ser473 and weakly at Thr308 without alteration of phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), and RSK1, resulting in abrogation of the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 and p70S6K at Thr389. Moreover, we found that epimagnolin suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73, resulting in the inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation activity. Computational docking indicated that epimagnolin targeted an active pocket of the mTOR kinase domain by forming three hydrogen bonds and three hydrophobic interactions. The prediction was confirmed by using in vitro kinase and adenosine triphosphate-bead competition assays. The inhibition of mTOR kinase activity resulted in the suppression of anchorage-independent cell transformation. Importantly, epimagnolin efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth of H1650 rather than H460 lung cancer cells with dependency of total and phosphorylated protein levels of mTOR and Akt. Inhibitory signaling of epimagnolin on cell proliferation of lung cancer cells was observed mainly in mTOR-Akt-p70S6K and mTOR-Akt-GSK3β-AP-1, which was similar to that shown in JB6 Cl41 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that epimagnolin potentiates as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents by direct active pocket targeting of mTOR kinase, resulting in sensitizing cancer cells harboring enhanced phosphorylation of the mTORC2-Akt-p70S6k signaling pathway.",

Activated α(2)M (α(2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of α(2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies. RESULTS: Stimulation of cells with α(2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. α(2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced α(2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. α(2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces α(2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates. CONCLUSION: Binding of α(2)M* to prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 upregulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and promotes protein synthesis in the prostate cancer cells.",

            "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure and leads to a reduction in the survival rate of cancer patients. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are aberrantly activated in many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which may indicate an association with breast cancer chemoresistance. In this study, we generated a chemoresistant human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231/gemcitabine (simplified hereafter as \"231/Gem\"), from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry studies revealed that with the same treatment concentration of gemcitabine, 231/Gem cells displayed more robust resistance to gemcitabine, which was reflected by fewer apoptotic cells and enhanced percentage of S-phase cells. Through the use of inverted microscopy, Cell Counting Kit-8, and Transwell assays, we found that compared with parental 231 cells, 231/Gem cells displayed more morphologic projections, enhanced cell proliferative ability, and improved cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathways were activated through elevated expression of phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and reduced expression of p-P38 and LC3-II (the marker of autophagy) in 231/Gem in comparison to control cells. However, there was no change in the expression of Cyclin D1 and p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In culture, inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and mTOR, but not of MEK/MAPK, could reverse the enhanced proliferative ability of 231/Gem cells. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor decreased the expression levels of p-AKT, p-MEK, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K; however, treatments with either MEK/MAPK or mTOR inhibitor significantly increased p-AKT expression. Thus, our data suggest that gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells is mainly mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This occurs through elevated expression of p-AKT protein to promote cell proliferation and is negatively regulated by the MEK/MAPK and mTOR pathways.",

The reciprocal relation that exists between the two activating phosphorylation sites of Akt, T308 and S473, and the two mTOR complexes, C1 and C2, forms the central controlling hub that regulates these cellular functions. In our previous review \"PI3Kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in cell cycle\" we discussed the reciprocal relation between mTORC1 and C2 complexes in regulating cell metabolism and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. We present in this article, a hypothesis that activation of Akt-T308 phosphorylation in the presence of high ATP:AMP ratio promotes the stability of its phosphorylations and activates mTORC1 and the energy consuming biosynthetic processes. Depletion of energy leads to inactivation of mTORC1, activation of AMPK, FoxO, and promotes constitution of mTORC2 that leads to phosphorylation of Akt S473. Akt can also be activated independent of PI3K; this appears to have an advantage under situations like dietary restrictions, where insulin/insulin growth factor signaling could be a casualty.",

            "abstract": "HER2 overexpression drives Akt signaling and cell survival and HER2-enriched breast tumors have a poor outcome when Akt is upregulated. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at T308 via PI3K and S473 via mTORC2. The importance of PI3K-activated Akt signaling is well documented in HER2-amplified breast cancer models, but the significance of mTORC2-activated Akt signaling in this setting remains uncertain. We report here that the mTORC2 obligate cofactor Rictor is enriched in HER2-amplified samples, correlating with increased phosphorylation at S473 on Akt. In invasive breast cancer specimens, Rictor expression was upregulated significantly compared with nonmalignant tissues. In a HER2/Neu mouse model of breast cancer, genetic ablation of Rictor decreased cell survival and phosphorylation at S473 on Akt, delaying tumor latency, penetrance, and burden. In HER2-amplified cells, exposure to an mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor decreased Akt-dependent cell survival, including in cells resistant to lapatinib, where cytotoxicity could be restored. We replicated these findings by silencing Rictor in breast cancer cell lines, but not silencing the mTORC1 cofactor Raptor (RPTOR). Taken together, our findings establish that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling drives Akt-dependent tumor progression in HER2-amplified breast cancers, rationalizing clinical investigation of dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitors and developing mTORC2-specific inhibitors for use in this setting.
