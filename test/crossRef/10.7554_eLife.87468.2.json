  "abstract": "<jats:p>MCM8 and MCM9 form a functional helicase complex (MCM8\/9) that plays an essential role in DNA homologous recombination repair for DNA double-strand break. However, the structural characterization of MCM8\/9 for DNA binding\/unwinding remains unclear. Here, we report structures of the MCM8\/9 complex using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis. The structures reveal that MCM8\/9 is arranged into a heterohexamer through a three-fold symmetry axis, creating a central channel that accommodates DNA. Multiple characteristic hairpins from the N-terminal oligosaccharide\/oligonucleotide (OB) domains of MCM8\/9 protrude into the central channel and serve to unwind the duplex DNA. When activated by HROB, the structure of MCM8\/9’s N-tier ring converts its symmetry from C3 to C1 with a conformational change that expands the MCM8\/9’s trimer interface. Moreover, our structural dynamic analyses revealed that the flexible C-tier ring exhibited rotary motions relative to the N-tier ring, which is required for the unwinding ability of MCM8\/9. In summary, our structural and biochemistry study provide a basis for understanding the DNA unwinding mechanism of MCM8\/9 helicase in homologous recombination.<\/jats:p>",
