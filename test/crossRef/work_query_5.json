However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCR are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we used a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCRα repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. For both subsets, we observed challenge-specific clonal expansion yielding homologous TCRα clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which were reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some clusters were shared across cancer challenges, suggesting response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response did not overlap, indicating the distinct origin of the two cell subsets. At the same time, we observed such overlap at the sites of certain tumor challenges. The overlaps included dominant responding TCRα motif and characteristic iNKT TCRα, suggesting the tumor-induced eCD4-eTreg plasticity. Our TCRα repertoire analysis also demonstrated that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge, revealing the homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations. Altogether, our study highlights both challenge-specific and tissue-specific responses of Treg cells associated with distinct clonal expansions.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Suppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells is dependent on signaling of their antigen receptors triggered by cognate self, dietary or microbial antigens in the form of peptide-MHC class II complexes. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCR are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we used a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCRα repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. For both subsets, we observed challenge-specific clonal expansion yielding homologous TCRα clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which were reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some clusters were shared across cancer challenges, suggesting response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response did not overlap, indicating the distinct origin of the two cell subsets. At the same time, we observed such overlap at the sites of certain tumor challenges. The overlaps included dominant responding TCRα motif and characteristic iNKT TCRα, suggesting the tumor-induced eCD4-eTreg plasticity. Our TCRα repertoire analysis also demonstrated that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge, revealing the homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations. Altogether, our study highlights both challenge-specific and tissue-specific responses of Treg cells associated with distinct clonal expansions.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Temporal analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire has been used to monitor treatment-induced changes in antigen-specific T cells in patients with cancer. However, the lack of experimental models that allow temporal analysis of the TCR repertoire in the same individual in a homogeneous population limits the understanding of the causal relationship between changes in TCR repertoire and antitumor responses. A bilateral tumor model, where tumor cells were inoculated bilaterally into the backs of mice, could be used for temporal analysis of the TCR repertoire. This study examined the prerequisite for this strategy: the TCR repertoire is conserved between bilateral tumors with the same growth rate. Bilateral tumors with equivalent size and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) were collected 13 days after tumor inoculation to analyze the TCR repertoire of CD4<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> and CD8<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> T cells. The tumor-infiltrating T cell clones were highly conserved between the bilateral tumors, and the extent of clonal expansion was equivalent. In addition, the similarity between the bilateral tumors was equivalent to heterogeneity on one side of the tumor. The similarity of the TCR repertoire in the bilateral dLNs was markedly lower than that in the tumor, suggesting that tumor-reactive T cell clones induced independently in each dLN integrated during recirculation and then infiltrated the tumor. These findings suggest that our bilateral tumor model is suitable for temporal monitoring of the TCR repertoire to evaluate temporal and treatment-induced changes in tumor-reactive T cell clones.<\/jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance Statement<\/jats:title><jats:p>The bilateral subcutaneous tumor model, where tumor cells were inoculated bilaterally into the backs of mice, is a promising model for temporal analysis of the antitumor response in cancer immunotherapy. This study demonstrated a highly conserved TCR repertoire in bilateral tumors and provided the basis for using a bilateral tumor model for evaluating temporal and treatment-induced changes in tumor-responsive T cell clones in individual mice. In humans, accurate statistical analysis is hampered by various background factors, including cancer type and stage and history of treatment. Moreover, temporal tumor biopsy in patients is highly invasive. Our bilateral tumor model overcomes these clinical issues and is expected to be a valuable tool for the development of novel immune monitoring and therapeutic strategies.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>",
