            "Abstract": "Cell migration requires coordination between integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and force applied to adhesion sites. Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance inÂ vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

            "abstract": "The link between extracellular-matrix-bound integrins and intracellular F-actin is essential for cell spreading and migration. Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "SUMMARY: Stimuli that promote cell migration, such as chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors in metazoans and cyclic AMP in Dictyostelium, activate signaling pathways that control organization of the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion complexes. The Rho-family GTPases are a key convergence point of these pathways. Their effectors include actin regulators such as formins, members of the WASP/WAVE family and the Arp2/3 complex, and the myosin II motor protein. Pathways that link to the Rho GTPases include Ras GTPases, TorC2, and PI3K. Many of the molecules involved form gradients within cells, which define the front and rear of migrating cells, and are also established in related cellular behaviors such as neuronal growth cone extension and cytokinesis. The signaling molecules that regulate migration can be integrated to provide a model of network function. The network displays biochemical excitability seen as spontaneous waves of activation that propagate along the cell cortex. These events coordinate cell movement and can be biased by external cues to bring about directed migration.",

As the primary receptors involved in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins present on the surface of tumor and stromal cells have a profound impact on the ability to survive in specific locations, but in some cases, these receptors can also function in the absence of ligand binding to promote stemness and survival in the presence of environmental and therapeutic stresses. Understanding how integrin expression and function is regulated in this context will enable the development of new therapeutic approaches to sensitize tumors to therapy and suppress their metastatic phenotype.

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM)-bound GTPase Rap1 recruits the Rap1-interacting-adaptor-molecule (RIAM), which in turn recruits talin to bind and activate integrins. However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

LD motifs are required for embryogenesis, wound healing and the evolution of multicellularity. LD motifs also play roles in disease, such as in cancer metastasis or viral infection. First described in the paxillin family of scaffolding proteins, LD motifs and similar acidic LXXLL interaction motifs have been discovered in several other proteins, whereas 16 proteins have been reported to contain LDBDs (LD motif-binding domains). Collectively, structural and functional analyses have revealed a surprising multivalency in LD motif interactions and a wide diversity in LDBD architectures. In the present review, we summarize the molecular basis for function, regulation and selectivity of LD motif interactions that has emerged from more than a decade of research. This overview highlights the intricate multi-level regulation and the inherently noisy and heterogeneous nature of signalling through short protein-protein interaction motifs.",

Here we use magnetic tweezers to characterise the mechano-sensitive compact N-terminal region of the talin rod, and show that the three helical bundles R1-R3 in this region unfold in three distinct steps consistent with the domains unfolding independently. Mechanical stretching of talin R1-R3 enhances its binding to vinculin and vinculin binding inhibits talin refolding after force is released. Mutations that stabilize R3 identify it as the initial mechano-sensing domain in talin, unfolding at â¼5âpN, suggesting that 5âpN is the force threshold for vinculin binding and adhesion progression.

In this review, we focus on RhoA and Rac1--2 Rho GTPases that are required for efficient adhesion and migration--and describe how specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) regulate the extensive crosstalk that exists between them. In particular, we assess the role of GEFs and GAPs in light of recent, unexpected evidence concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between RhoA and Rac1 at the leading edge of migrating cells. Force is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of cell adhesion and we highlight the role of GEFs and GAPs in mechanotransduction, before debating the controversial role of tension in focal adhesion maturation.",

Talins and kindlins, two families of FERM-domain proteins, bind the cytoplasmic tail of integrins, recruit cytoskeletal and signalling proteins involved in mechanotransduction and synergize to activate integrin binding to extracellular ligands. New data reveal the domain structure of full-length talin, provide insights into talin-mediated integrin activation and show that RIAM recruits talin to the plasma membrane, whereas vinculin stabilizes talin in cell-matrix junctions. How kindlins act is less well-defined, but disease-causing mutations show that kindlins are also essential for integrin activation, adhesion, cell spreading and signalling. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large adaptor protein that activates integrins and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cells sense the extracellular environment using adhesion receptors (integrins) linked to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton through a complex network of regulatory proteins that, all together, form focal adhesions (FAs). The molecular basis of how these sensing units are regulated, how they are implicated in transducing mechanical stimuli, and how this leads to a spatiotemporal coordination of FAs is unclear. RESULTS: Here we show that vinculin, through its links to the talin-integrin complex and F-actin, regulates the transmission of mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix to the actomyosin machinery. We demonstrate that the vinculin interaction with the talin-integrin complex drives the recruitment and release of core FA components. The activation state of vinculin is itself regulated by force, as underscored by our observation that vinculin localization to FAs is dependent on actomyosin contraction. Using a variety of vinculin mutants, we establish which components of the cell-matrix adhesion network are coordinated through direct and indirect associations with vinculin. Moreover, using cyclic stretching, we demonstrate that vinculin plays a key role in the transmission of extracellular mechanical stimuli leading to the reorganization of cell polarity. Of particular importance is the actin-binding tail region of vinculin, without which the cell's ability to repolarize in response to cyclic stretching is perturbed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall our data promote a model whereby vinculin controls the transmission of intracellular and extracellular mechanical cues that are important for the spatiotemporal assembly, disassembly, and reorganization of FAs to coordinate polarized cell motility.",

The Rac exchange factor Tiam1 participates in polarized cell migration with the PAR complex of PAR3, PAR6, and atypical protein kinase C. However, it remains largely unknown how Tiam1 is regulated and contributes to the establishment of polarity in migrating cells. We show here that Tiam1 interacts directly with talin, which binds and activates integrins to mediate their signaling. Tiam1 accumulated at adhesions in a manner dependent on talin and the PAR complex. The interactions of talin with Tiam1 and the PAR complex were required for adhesion-induced Rac1 activation, cell spreading, and migration toward integrin substrates. Furthermore, Tiam1 acted with talin to regulate adhesion turnover. Thus, we propose that Tiam1, with the PAR complex, binds to integrins through talin and, together with the PAR complex, thereby regulates Rac1 activity and adhesion turnover for polarized migration.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration requires the coordination of adhesion site assembly and turnover. Canonical models for nascent adhesion formation postulate that integrin binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins results in the rapid recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and paxillin to integrin cytoplasmic domains. It is thought that integrin-talin clusters recruit and activate tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). However, the molecular connections of this linkage remain unresolved. Our recent findings support an alternative model whereby FAK recruits talin to new sites of Î²1 integrin-mediated adhesion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human ovarian carcinoma cells. This is dependent on a direct binding interaction between FAK and talin and occurs independently of direct talin binding to Î²1 integrin. Herein, we discuss differences between nascent and mature adhesions, interactions between FAK, talin and paxillin, possible mechanisms of FAK activation and how this FAK-talin complex may function to promote cell motility through increased adhesion turnover.",

            "abstract": "The formation of tissues and organs requires cells to adhere to each other and/or to migrate and polarize in contact with components of the extracellular matrix. The connection between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment is provided by heterodimeric transmembrane receptors of the integrin family. In response to extracellular ligand binding, integrins undergo a conformational switch that permits the recruitment of cytoplasmic adapter proteins, eventually linking the integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, progressively forming highly complex cell-matrix adhesions. A major challenge in the field consists in identifying the regulatory mechanisms, which drive the assembly of cell-matrix adhesions as they are based on posttranslational modifications as well as allosteric conformational changes caused by protein-protein as well as protein-lipid interactions. In response to mechanical tension, generated either by intra-cellular acto-myosin contraction, shear stress or mechanical strain on the extracellular scaffold, the composition and signaling of cell-matrix adhesion changes, leading either to increased anchorage or controlled disassembly of cell matrix adhesions, both processes critically involved in cell migration. The aim of this review is to provide insight into the mechanisms leading to the progressive assembly of focal adhesions, how they are modulated in response to mechanical challenges and which mechanisms are used for their disassembly.",

Molecules in this network transmit and detect mechanical forces, which subsequently determine cell behavior and fate. Here, we reconstruct the mechanical pathway followed by these forces. From matrix proteins to actin through integrins and adaptor proteins, we review how forces affect the lifetime of bonds and stretch or alter the conformation of proteins, and how these mechanical changes are converted into biochemical signals in mechanotransduction events. We evaluate which of the proteins in the network can participate in mechanotransduction and which are simply responsible for transmitting forces in a dynamic network. Besides their individual properties, we also analyze how the mechanical responses of a protein are determined by their serial connections from the matrix to actin, their parallel connections in integrin clusters and by the rate at which force is applied to them. All these define mechanical molecular pathways in cells, which are emerging as key regulators of cell function alongside better studied biochemical pathways.",

New (nascent) adhesions form at the protruding cell edge in a tension-independent manner and are comprised of integrin receptors, signaling, and cytoskeletal-associated proteins. Integrins recruit focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the cytoskeletal protein talin to nascent adhesions. Canonical models support a role for talin in mediating FAK localization and activation at adhesions. Here, alternatively, we show that FAK promotes talin recruitment to nascent adhesions occurring independently of talin binding to Î²1 integrins. The direct binding site for talin on FAK was identified, and a point mutation in FAK (E1015A) prevented talin association and talin localization to nascent adhesions but did not alter integrin-mediated FAK recruitment and activation at adhesions. Moreover, FAK E1015A inhibited cell motility and proteolytic talin cleavage needed for efficient adhesion dynamics. These results support an alternative linkage for FAK-talin interactions within nascent adhesions essential for the control of cell migration.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Upon detachment from the extracellular matrix, tumor epithelial cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells are capable of overcoming anoikis, gain survival benefits, and hence contribute to the process of metastasis. The focal-adhesion complex formation recruits the association of key adaptor proteins such as FAK (focal-adhesion kinase). Vimentin, paxillin, and talin are responsible for mediating the interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and integrins. Talin is an early-recruited focal-adhesion player that is of structural and functional significance in mediating interactions with integrin cytoplasmic tails leading to destabilization of the transmembrane complex and resulting in rearrangements in the extracellular integrin compartments that mediate integrin activation. Talin-mediated integrin activation plays a definitive role in integrin-mediated signaling and induction of downstream survival pathways leading to protection from anoikis and consequently resulting in cancer progression to metastasis. We recently reported that talin expression is significantly increased in prostate cancer compared with benign and normal prostate tissue and that this overexpression correlates with progression to metastatic disease implicating a prognostic value for talin during tumor progression. At the molecular level, talin is functionally associated with enhanced survival and proliferation pathways and confers anoikis resistance and metastatic spread of primary tumor cells via activation of the Akt survival pathway. In this review, we discuss the growing evidence surrounding the value of talin as a prognostic marker of cancer progression to metastasis and as therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer, as well as the current understanding of mechanisms regulating its signaling activity in cancer.",

Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of Î±-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix Î±3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel Î²-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

Although SH2 domains have not been reported previously to be phosphorylated, the tensin-3 SH2 domain is a physiologic substrate for Src. Tyrosines in the SH2 domain contribute to the biological activity of tensin-3, and phosphorylation of these tyrosines can regulate ligand binding. In a mouse breast cancer model, tensin-3 tyrosines are phosphorylated in a Src-associated manner in primary tumors, and experimental metastases induced by tumor-derived cell lines depend on endogenous tensin-3. Thus, tensin-3 is implicated as an oncoprotein regulated by Src and possessing an SH2 domain with a previously undescribed mechanism for the regulation of ligand binding.",

For efficient movement, these processes must be spatiotemporally coordinated. To a large degree, the morphological changes and physical forces that occur during migration are generated by a dynamic filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. Adhesion is regulated by dynamic assemblies of structural and signaling proteins that couple the F-actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Here, we review current knowledge of the dynamic organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in cell migration and the regulation of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly with an emphasis on how mechanical and biochemical signaling between these two systems regulate the coordination of physical processes in cell migration.",

We show that mechanical stretching of single cytoplasmic proteins can activate binding of other molecules. We used magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy to investigate the effect of force on the interaction between talin, a protein that links liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system, molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system. Such protein stretching may be a more general mechanism for force transduction.",

            "abstract": "Cell spreading, adhesion and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involve bi-directional signalling and physical linkages between the ECM, integrins and the cell cytoskeleton. The actin-binding proteins talin1 and 2 link ligand-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and increase the affinity of integrin for the ECM. Here we report that depletion of talin2 in talin1-null (talin1(-/-)) cells did not affect the initiation of matrix-activated spreading or Src family kinase (SFK) activation, but abolished the ECM-integrin-cytoskeleton linkage and sustained cell spreading and adhesion. Specifically, focal adhesion assembly, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling and traction force generation on substrates were severely affected. The talin1 head domain restored beta1 integrin activation but only full-length talin1 restored the ECM-cytoskeleton linkage and normal cytoskeleton organization. Our results demonstrate three biochemically distinct steps in fibronectin-activated cell spreading and adhesion: (1) fibronectin-integrin binding and initiation of spreading, (2) fast cell spreading and (3) focal adhesion formation and substrate traction. We suggest that talin is not required for initial cell spreading. However, talin provides the important mechanical linkage between ligand-bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton required to catalyse focal adhesion-dependent pathways.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large dimeric protein that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

The interaction of LD motifs with their targets plays an important role in the assembly of FAs. We have determined the molecular basis for the recognition of two paxillin LD motifs by the FA targeting (FAT) domain of FA kinase using a combination of X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and homology modeling. The four-helix FAT domain displays two LD binding sites on opposite sites of the molecule that bind LD peptides in a helical conformation. Threading studies suggest that the LD-interacting domain of p95PKL shares a common four-helical core with the FAT domain and the tail of vinculin, defining a structural family of LD motif binding modules.",

The C-terminal 'focal adhesion targeting' (FAT) region is necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions. We have determined the crystal structure of FAT and show that it forms a four-helix bundle that resembles those found in two other proteins involved in cell adhesion, alpha-catenin and vinculin. The binding of FAT to the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, requires the integrity of the helical bundle, whereas binding to another focal adhesion protein, talin, does not. We show by mutagenesis that paxillin binding involves two hydrophobic patches on opposite faces of the bundle and propose a model in which two LD motifs of paxillin adopt amphipathic helices that augment the hydrophobic core of FAT, creating a six-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor gene, which is frequently inactivated in cancer, encodes a Rho-GAP (GTPase activating protein) focal adhesion protein whose negative regulation of Rho-GTPases is necessary but not sufficient for its full tumor suppressor activity. Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

            "abstract": "Talin plays an important role in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK.

Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

            "abstract": "Talin mediates attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix. It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is downregulated in various tumor types. In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

Besides its RhoGAP domain, functions of other domains in DLC1 remain largely unknown. By protein precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1) as a novel partner for the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of DLC1 but not the SAM domain of DLC2. The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

We identify here a physiological interaction between DLC1, a focal adhesion protein and tumor suppressor, with SRC and ERK. The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

            "abstract": "DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer (DLC1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene recently isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma. Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "In advanced cancer, the RHOA GTPase is often active together with reduced expression of genes encoding Rho-specific GTPase-accelerating proteins (Rho-GAP), which negatively regulate RHOA and related GTPases. Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer (DLC1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene recently isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma. Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose full activity depends on its presence at focal adhesions, its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) function, and its ability to bind several ligands, including tensin and talin. However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

            "abstract": "The major mechanical function of talin is to couple the Î²-integrin cytoplasmic tails to actin filaments. A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a multi-modular Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and a tumor suppressor. Besides its RhoGAP domain, functions of other domains in DLC1 remain largely unknown. By protein precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1) as a novel partner for the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of DLC1 but not the SAM domain of DLC2. The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

            "abstract": "Talin plays an important role in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "SRC and ERK kinases control many cell biological processes that promote tumorigenesis by altering the activity of oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins. We identify here a physiological interaction between DLC1, a focal adhesion protein and tumor suppressor, with SRC and ERK. The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

            "abstract": "In advanced cancer, the RHOA GTPase is often active together with reduced expression of genes encoding Rho-specific GTPase-accelerating proteins (Rho-GAP), which negatively regulate RHOA and related GTPases. Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK. Acting in concert, both DLC1 and FAK could provide a unique spatio-temporal mechanism to regulate paxillin function in tissue homeostasis.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is downregulated in various tumor types. In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

            "abstract": "In advanced cancer, the RHOA GTPase is often active together with reduced expression of genes encoding Rho-specific GTPase-accelerating proteins (Rho-GAP), which negatively regulate RHOA and related GTPases. Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a tumor suppressor protein that is frequently downregulated in various tumor types. DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose full activity depends on its presence at focal adhesions, its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) function, and its ability to bind several ligands, including tensin and talin. However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

            "abstract": "Talin plays an important role in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK. Acting in concert, both DLC1 and FAK could provide a unique spatio-temporal mechanism to regulate paxillin function in tissue homeostasis.",

Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is downregulated in various tumor types. In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a multi-modular Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and a tumor suppressor. Besides its RhoGAP domain, functions of other domains in DLC1 remain largely unknown. By protein precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1) as a novel partner for the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of DLC1 but not the SAM domain of DLC2. The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a multi-modular Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and a tumor suppressor. Besides its RhoGAP domain, functions of other domains in DLC1 remain largely unknown. By protein precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1) as a novel partner for the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of DLC1 but not the SAM domain of DLC2. The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer (DLC1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene recently isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma. Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose full activity depends on its presence at focal adhesions, its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) function, and its ability to bind several ligands, including tensin and talin. However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK. Acting in concert, both DLC1 and FAK could provide a unique spatio-temporal mechanism to regulate paxillin function in tissue homeostasis.",

DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

            "abstract": "SRC and ERK kinases control many cell biological processes that promote tumorigenesis by altering the activity of oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins. We identify here a physiological interaction between DLC1, a focal adhesion protein and tumor suppressor, with SRC and ERK. The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Talin mediates attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix. It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The major mechanical function of talin is to couple the Î²-integrin cytoplasmic tails to actin filaments. A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

            "abstract": "In advanced cancer, the RHOA GTPase is often active together with reduced expression of genes encoding Rho-specific GTPase-accelerating proteins (Rho-GAP), which negatively regulate RHOA and related GTPases. Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose full activity depends on its presence at focal adhesions, its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) function, and its ability to bind several ligands, including tensin and talin. However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

            "abstract": "SRC and ERK kinases control many cell biological processes that promote tumorigenesis by altering the activity of oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins. We identify here a physiological interaction between DLC1, a focal adhesion protein and tumor suppressor, with SRC and ERK. The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer (DLC1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene recently isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma. Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

Besides its RhoGAP domain, functions of other domains in DLC1 remain largely unknown. By protein precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1) as a novel partner for the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of DLC1 but not the SAM domain of DLC2. The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Talin plays an important role in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a tumor suppressor protein that is frequently downregulated in various tumor types. DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK. Acting in concert, both DLC1 and FAK could provide a unique spatio-temporal mechanism to regulate paxillin function in tissue homeostasis.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

            "abstract": "The link between extracellular-matrix-bound integrins and intracellular F-actin is essential for cell spreading and migration. Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "Filamin plays a key role in cellular biomechanics as an actin cross-linker and as a versatile focal adhesion binding partner. It binds directly to integrins, a family of mechanosensitive transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to several extracellular ligands such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Filamin binds Î²-integrin at its cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a major integrin activator that plays a chief role in cell adhesion. Herein, we develop molecular dynamics models to study the mechanism of early binding of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin with filamin A (FLNa). Our models predict three important electrostatic interactions and one stabilizing hydrophobic interaction that mediate binding between filamin and integrin. In its native conformation, filamin's integrin binding site is auto-inhibited. Our models help shed light on the role of integrin binding on regulating filamin activation. Finally, the effect of talin on the filamin-integrin interaction is explored and possible scenarios of the interplay among these molecules are examined. ",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610",

            "abstract": "The link between extracellular-matrix-bound integrins and intracellular F-actin is essential for cell spreading and migration. Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "Deleted in Liver Cancer-1 (DLC1) is a RhoGTPase-activating protein (GAP) and a tumor suppressor often downregulated in cancers. It is localized to the focal adhesions (FAs) and its absence leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Although DLC1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and tensin, its role in focal adhesions dynamics remains unclear. We examined the effect of DLC1 in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts and determined its localization, dynamics and impact on paxillin by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching at both nascent and mature focal adhesions. During early cell spreading, DLC1 is preferentially localized at the inner/mature adhesions whereas phosphorylated paxillin occupies the outer/nascent FAs. In addition, DLC1 downregulates paxillin turnover in a process, that does not require its GAP activity. Instead, it requires the presence of FAK. Acting in concert, both DLC1 and FAK could provide a unique spatio-temporal mechanism to regulate paxillin function in tissue homeostasis.",

It is targeted by the Rap1 effector RIAM to focal adhesion sites and subsequently undergoes force-induced conformational opening to recruit the actin-interacting protein vinculin. The conformational switch involves the talin R3 domain, which binds RIAM when closed and vinculin when open. Here, we apply pressure to R3 and measure 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift changes, which are fitted using a simple model, and indicate that R3 is only 50% closed: the closed form is a four-helix bundle, while in the open state helix 1 is twisted out. Strikingly, a mutant of R3 that binds RIAM with an affinity similar to wild-type but more weakly to vinculin is shown to be 0.84Â kJ mol-1 more stable when closed. These results demonstrate that R3 is thermodynamically poised to bind either RIAM or vinculin, and thus constitutes a good mechanosensitive switch.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer (DLC1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene recently isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma. Structurally, DLC1 protein contains a conserved GTPase-activating protein for Rho family protein (RhoGAP) domain, which has been thought to regulate the activity of Rho family proteins. Previous studies indicated that DLC1 was frequently inactivated in cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor suppressor roles of DLC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that DLC1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity when stably expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression greatly reduced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With RhoGAP-deficient DLC1 mutant (DLC1-K714E), we showed that the RhoGAP activity was essential for DLC1-mediated tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, the 292- to 648-amino acid region and the steroidogenic acute regulatory related lipid transfer domain played an auxiliary role to RhoGAP and tumor suppressor function of DLC1. Taken together, our findings showed that DLC1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell growth by negatively regulating the activity of Rho proteins.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose full activity depends on its presence at focal adhesions, its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) function, and its ability to bind several ligands, including tensin and talin. However, the mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood. Here we identify CDK5, a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, as an important regulator of DLC1 functions. The CDK5 kinase phosphorylates four serines in DLC1 located N-terminal to the Rho-GAP domain. When not phosphorylated, this N-terminal region functions as an autoinhibitory domain that places DLC1 in a closed, inactive conformation by efficiently binding to the Rho-GAP domain. CDK5 phosphorylation reduces this binding and orchestrates the coordinate activation DLC1, including its localization to focal adhesions, its Rho-GAP activity, and its ability to bind tensin and talin. In cancer, these anti-oncogenic effects of CDK5 can provide selective pressure for the down-regulation of DLC1, which occurs frequently in tumors, and can contribute to the pro-oncogenic activity of CDK5 in lung adenocarcinoma.

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 inÂ vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

            "abstract": "The DLC1 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that functions as a tumor suppressor in several common human cancers. The multidomain structure of DLC1 enables interaction with a number of other proteins. Here we report that the proinflammatory protein S100A10 (also known as p11), a key cell surface receptor for plasminogen which regulates pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion, is a new binding partner of DLC1 in human cells. We determined that the 2 proteins colocalize in the cell cytoplasm and that their binding is mediated by central sequences in the central domain of DLC1 and the C-terminus of S100A10. Because the same S100A10 sequence also mediates binding to Annexin 2, we found that DLC1 competed with Annexin 2 for interaction with S100A10. DLC1 binding to S100A10 did not affect DLC1's RhoGAP activity, but it decreased the steady-state level of S100A10 expression in a dose-dependent manner by displacing it from Annexin 2 and making it accessible to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process attenuated plasminogen activation and resulted in inhibition of in vitro cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of aggressive lung cancer cells. These results suggest that a novel GAP-independent mechanism contributes to the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1, and highlight the importance and complexity of protein-protein interactions involving DLC1 in certain cancers.",

We identify here a physiological interaction between DLC1, a focal adhesion protein and tumor suppressor, with SRC and ERK. The tumor suppressor function of DLC1 is attenuated by phosphorylation of tyrosines Y451 and Y701 by SRC, which down-regulates DLC1's tensin-binding and Rho-GAP activities. ERK1/2 phosphorylate DLC1 on serine S129, which increases both the binding of SRC to DLC1 and SRC-dependent phosphorylation of DLC1. SRC inhibitors exhibit potent antitumor activity in a DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and a DLC1-positive tumor xenograft model, due to reactivation of the tumor suppressor activities of DLC1. Combined treatment of DLC1-positive tumors with SRC plus AKT inhibitors has even greater antitumor activity. Together, these findings indicate cooperation between the SRC, ERK1/2, and AKT kinases to reduce DLC1 Rho-GAP and tumor suppressor activities in cancer cells, which can be reactivated by the kinase inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "Talin plays an important role in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Talin function is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between the integrin-binding F3 domain and the autoinhibitory domain (R9). We determined the crystal structure of a triple-domain fragment, R7R8R9, which contains R9 and the RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule) binding domain (R8). The structure reveals a crystallographic contact between R9 and a symmetrically related R8 domain, representing a homodimeric interaction in talin. Strikingly, we demonstrated that the Î±5 helix of R9 also interacts with the F3 domain, despite no interdomain contact involving the Î±5 helix in the crystal structure of an F2F3:R9 autoinhibitory complex reported previously. Mutations on the Î±5 helix significantly diminish the F3:R9 association and lead to elevated talin activity. Our results offer biochemical and functional evidence of the existence of a new talin autoinhibitory configuration, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of talin autoinhibition, regulation, and quaternary structure assembly.",

            "abstract": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5Î² and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.",

The solution structure of DLC1 SAM revealed a new monomeric fold with four parallel helices, similar to that of DLC2 SAM but distinct from other SAM domains. Mutating F38, L39 and F40 within a hydrophobic patch retained its overall structure but abolished its interaction with EF1A1 with F38 and L39 forming an indispensable interacting motif. DLC1 SAM did not localize to and was not required for DLC1 to suppress the turnover of focal adhesions. Instead, DLC1 SAM facilitated EF1A1 distribution to the membrane periphery and ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Compared with wild-type DLC1, the non-interactive DLC1 mutant is less potent in suppressing cell migration, whereas overexpression of the DLC1 SAM domain alone, but not the non-interactive mutant SAM or DLC2 SAM, greatly enhanced cell migration. This finding reveals a novel contribution of the SAM-EF1A1 interaction as a potentially important GAP-independent modulation of cell migration by DLC1.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1-DLC1-RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

            "abstract": "Vinculin is a talin-binding protein that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, but the mechanisms are not understood. Because talin is a direct activator of integrins, we asked whether and how vinculin regulates the formation of integrin: talin complexes. We report that VD1 (aa 1-258) and its talin-binding mutant, VD1A50I, bind directly and equally to several Î² integrin cytoplasmic tails (Î²CT). Results from competition assays show that VD1, but not VD1A50I, inhibits the interaction of talin (Tn) and talin rod (TnR), but not talin head (TnH) with Î²3CT. The inhibition observed could be the result of VD1 binding to one or more of the 11 vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the TnR domain. Our studies demonstrate that VD1 binding to amino acids 482-911, a VBS rich region, in TnR perturbs the interaction of rod with Î²3CT. The integrin activation assays done using CHOA5 cells show that activated vinculin enhances Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin activation and that the effect is dependent on talin. The TnR domain however shows no integrin activation unlike TnH that shows enhanced integrin activation. The overall results indicate that activated vinculin promotes talin-mediated integrin activation by binding to accessible VBSs in TnR and thus displacing the TnR from the Î²3 subunit. The study presented, defines a novel direct interaction of VD1 with Î²3CT and provides an attractive explanation for vinculin's ability to potentiate integrin-mediated cell adhesion through directly binding to both TnR and the integrin cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "In advanced cancer, the RHOA GTPase is often active together with reduced expression of genes encoding Rho-specific GTPase-accelerating proteins (Rho-GAP), which negatively regulate RHOA and related GTPases. Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1. Thus, mutation of Rho-GAP genes occurs frequently in some cancer types and the majority of cancer-associated DLC1 mutants evaluated were deficient biologically, with various mechanisms contributing to their reduced activity. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that point mutation of Rho-GAP genes is unexpectedly frequent in several cancer types, with DLC1 mutants exhibiting reduced function by various mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical unfolding of proteins is a cellular mechanism for force transduction with potentially broad implications in cell fate. Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

Although DLC1 expression has been studied at the transcriptional level, little is known about its regulation at the protein level. Here we show that DLC1 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In addition, five putative PEST motifs were identified in the N-terminus of DLC1. Unexpectedly, the N-terminus of DLC1 appeared to be stable. Furthermore, deletion of any one of the five PEST motifs except PEST2 decreased the stability of the N-terminus of DLC1, which suggests that the PEST motifs may play an unrevealed role in maintaining the stability of DLC1. These data indicated that the intracellular stability of DLC1 is regulated by the 26S proteasome via its PEST motifs.",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is downregulated in various tumor types. In vitro, DLC1 specifically inactivates the small GTPases RhoA, RhoB and RhoC through its GAP domain and this appears to contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo. Molecular mechanisms that control DLC1 activity have not so far been investigated. Here, we show that phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase D stimulates association of DLC1 with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via recognition motifs that involve Ser327 and Ser431. Association with 14-3-3 proteins inhibits DLC1 GAP activity and facilitates signaling by active Rho. We further show that treatment of cells with phorbol ester or coexpression of 14-3-3 proteins, blocks DLC1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, probably by masking a previously unrecognized nuclear localization sequence. The binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thus a newly discovered mechanism by which DLC1 activity is regulated and compartmentalized.",

            "abstract": "The major mechanical function of talin is to couple the Î²-integrin cytoplasmic tails to actin filaments. A variety of Î²-integrin tails contain conserved binding motifs for talin, and recent research shows that Î²-integrins differ both in affinity to talin and preferences for other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. While talin predominantly links Î²3 integrins to actin filaments within the peripheral cell adhesion sites, talin can become replaced by other integrin adaptor proteins through their overlapping binding sites on integrin tails. Although the NPxY motif in the Î²-integrin tail is important for talin recognition, our simulations suggest considerably smaller contribution of the NPxY motif in the force resistance of the talin-integrin complex than for the residues upstream of the NPxY. It might thus be possible for the NPxY motif to detach from talin and interact with other integrin binding proteins while the Î²-integrin still remains bound to talin. The epithelial integrin Î²6 reportedly activates latent TGFÎ²1, and we propose that its function may involve direct interaction with talin. ",

            "abstract": "The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor is an important RhoGTP activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in many types of human cancers. Small GTPases regulate normal cellular processes but aberrant expression and activation of GTPases contribute to tumorigenesis. RhoGAP suppresses Rho activity. DLC1's RhoGAP activity and the focal adhesion localization are critical to the tumor suppressor functions of DLC1. Frequent DLC1 underexpression is commonly seen in human cancers and has been ascribed to genomic deletion and epigenetic inactivation. Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1. Deregulation of DLC1 in cells results in the elevation of active Rho. Compelling studies of the molecular mechanisms of DLC1 action have identified various interacting partners of DLC1 such as tensins and caveolin-1, and revealed the associated signaling pathways. DLC1 has been shown to be a promiscuous interacting protein. Recent interest has also focused on the phosphorylation of DLC1. The upstream kinases such as PKA, PKB/Akt and PKC, and the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activities of DLC1 have been demonstrated. Although DLC1 is a RhoGAP, RhoGAP-independent pathways have been involved via its interacting partners and upon phosphorylation regulation. Recent studies of DLC1 point to the complexity of the signaling pathways it regulates. This review summarizes the current understanding of the interacting potentials of DLC1 and phosphorylation of DLC1. ",

            "abstract": "Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene frequently underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DLC1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain that exhibits growth-suppressive activity in HCC cell lines. Our recent finding has revealed that inhibition of Rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation by DLC1 is associated with its growth inhibitory activity. In the present study, we identified tensin2 as the novel binding partner of DLC1. Tensin2 belongs to a new family of focal adhesion proteins that play key roles in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Dysregulation of tensin proteins has previously been implicated in human cancers. Tensin2 is highly expressed in human liver. Introduction of tensin2 into HCC cell lines with low expression of tensin2 caused significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Tensin2 directly interacted with DLC1 in vitro and in vivo. Both proteins localized to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis of DLC1 and tensin2 identified caveolin-1 binding motif in both proteins. In vivo immunoprecipitation study confirmed that both proteins indeed interacted with endogenous caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae. Our findings presented here suggest a new model for the action of DLC1 in hepatocytes, whereby DLC1-tensin2 complex interacts with Rho GTPases in caveolae to effect cytoskeletal reorganization.",

            "abstract": "The protein deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) interacts with the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins to play a role as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of human cancers. This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2.",

            "abstract": "Talin interacts with Î²-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation, thus regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2, and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, we show here that talin2 has a higher affinity to Î²1-integrin tails than talin1. Mutation of talin2 S339 to leucine, which can cause Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, completely disrupted its binding to Î²-integrin tails. Also, substitution of talin1 C336 with Ser enhanced the affinity of talin1, whereas substitution of talin2 S339 with Cys diminished that of talin2. Further computational modeling analysis shows that talin2 S339 formed a hydrogen bond with E353, which is critical for inducing key hydrogen bonds between talin2 N326 and Î²1-integrin R760, and between talin2 K327 and Î²1-integrin D759. Mutation at any of these residues significantly diminished the interaction of talin2 with Î²1- integrin tails. These hydrogen bonds were not observed in talin1/Î²1-integrin, but did exist in talin1C336S/Î²1-integrin complex. These results suggest that talin2 S339 forms a hydrogen bond with E353 to mediate its high affinity to Î²1-integrin.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",
