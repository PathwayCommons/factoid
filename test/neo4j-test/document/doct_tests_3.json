            "Abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

            "abstract": "One of the major unsolved mysteries of biological science concerns the question of where and in what form information is stored in the brain. I propose that memory is stored in the brain in a mechanically encoded binary format written into the conformations of proteins found in the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions that organise each and every synapse. The MeshCODE framework outlined here represents a unifying theory of data storage in animals, providing read-write storage of both dynamic and persistent information in a binary format. Mechanosensitive proteins that contain force-dependent switches can store information persistently, which can be written or updated using small changes in mechanical force. These mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, scaffold each synapse, creating a meshwork of switches that together form a code, the so-called MeshCODE. Large signalling complexes assemble on these scaffolds as a function of the switch patterns and these complexes would both stabilise the patterns and coordinate synaptic regulators to dynamically tune synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains would operate the cytoskeletal machinery to write and update the synaptic MeshCODEs, thereby propagating this coding throughout the organism. Based on established biophysical principles, such a mechanical basis for memory would provide a physical location for data storage in the brain, with the binary patterns, encoded in the information-storing mechanosensitive molecules in the synaptic scaffolds, and the complexes that form on them, representing the physical location of engrams. Furthermore, the conversion and storage of sensory and temporal inputs into a binary format would constitute an addressable read-write memory system, supporting the view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.",

            "abstract": "Comparative genome- and proteome-wide screens yield large amounts of data. To efficiently present such datasets and to simplify the identification of hits, the results are often presented in a type of scatterplot known as a volcano plot, which shows a measure of effect size versus a measure of significance. The data points with the largest effect size and a statistical significance beyond a user-defined threshold are considered as hits. Such hits are usually annotated in the plot by a label with their name. Volcano plots can represent ten thousands of data points, of which typically only a handful is annotated. The information of data that is not annotated is hardly or not accessible. To simplify access to the data and enable its re-use, we have developed an open source and online web tool with R/Shiny. The web app is named VolcaNoseR and it can be used to create, explore, label and share volcano plots ( https://huygens.science.uva.nl/VolcaNoseR ). When the data is stored in an online data repository, the web app can retrieve that data together with user-defined settings to generate a customized, interactive volcano plot. Users can interact with the data, adjust the plot and share their modified plot together with the underlying data. Therefore, VolcaNoseR increases the transparency and re-use of large comparative genome- and proteome-wide datasets.",

            "abstract": "More than 250 proteins are associated with the formation of integrin adhesion complexes involving a vast number of complex interactions between them. These interactions enable adhesions to serve as dynamic and diverse mechanosignaling centers. Our laboratory focuses on the biochemical and structural study of these interactions to help unpick this complex network. Here, we describe the general pipeline of biochemical assays and methods we use. The chapter is split into two sections: (1) protein production and characterization and (2) biochemical assays for the characterization of binding between full-length proteins and/or specific regions of proteins with other proteins, peptides, and phospholipids. The suite of assays we use routinely includes circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for sample quality assessment, prior to biochemical analysis using NMR, fluorescence polarization (FP), microscale thermophoresis (MST), size-exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), and pulldown/cosedimentation-based approaches. The results of our analysis feed into in vivo studies that allow for the elucidation of the biological role of each interaction.",

The composition, interactions, stoichiometry, and topological organization of proteins within IACs are not fully understood. To address this gap, we used multiplexed proximity biotinylation (BioID) to generate an in situ, proximity-dependent adhesome in mouse pancreatic fibroblasts. Integration of the interactomes of 16 IAC-associated baits revealed a network of 147 proteins with 361 proximity interactions. Candidates with underappreciated roles in adhesion were identified, in addition to established IAC components. Bioinformatic analysis revealed five clusters of IAC baits that link to common groups of prey, and which therefore may represent functional modules. The five clusters, and their spatial associations, are consistent with current models of IAC interaction networks and stratification. This study provides a resource to examine proximal relationships within IACs at a global level.",

            "abstract": "A large body of literature is available on wound healing in humans. Nonetheless, a standardized ex vivo wound model without disruption of the dermal compartment has not been put forward with compelling justification. Here, we present a novel wound model based on application of negative pressure and its effects for epidermal regeneration and immune cell behaviour. Importantly, the basement membrane remained intact after blister roof removal and keratinocytes were absent in the wounded area. Upon six days of culture, the wound was covered with one to three-cell thick K14+Ki67+ keratinocyte layers, indicating that proliferation and migration were involved in wound closure. After eight to twelve days, a multi-layered epidermis was formed expressing epidermal differentiation markers (K10, filaggrin, DSG-1, CDSN). Investigations about immune cell-specific manners revealed more T cells in the blister roof epidermis compared to normal epidermis. We identified several cell populations in blister roof epidermis and suction blister fluid that are absent in normal epidermis which correlated with their decrease in the dermis, indicating a dermal efflux upon negative pressure. Together, our model recapitulates the main features of epithelial wound regeneration, and can be applied for testing wound healing therapies and investigating underlying mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Diffraction (X-ray, neutron and electron) and electron cryo-microscopy are powerful methods to determine three-dimensional macromolecular structures, which are required to understand biological processes and to develop new therapeutics against diseases. The overall structure-solution workflow is similar for these techniques, but nuances exist because the properties of the reduced experimental data are different. Software tools for structure determination should therefore be tailored for each method. Phenix is a comprehensive software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the transition between programs, project tracking and re-running of previous tasks.",

In this manuscript, we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2016. In the last 3 years, public data sharing through PRIDE (as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types. A new scalable and fault tolerant storage backend, Application Programming Interface and web interface have been implemented, as a part of an ongoing process. Additionally, we emphasize the improved support for quantitative proteomics data through the mzTab format. At last, we outline key statistics on the current data contents and volume of downloads, and how PRIDE data are starting to be disseminated to added-value resources including Ensembl, UniProt and Expression Atlas.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, is exquisitely sensitive to biochemical, structural, and mechanical features of the ECM. Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes.

Talins control the activation state of integrins, link integrins to cytoskeletal actin, recruit numerous signalling molecules that mediate integrin signalling and coordinate recruitment of microtubules to adhesion sites via interaction with KANK (kidney ankyrin repeat-containing) proteins. Vertebrates have two talin genes, TLN1 and TLN2. Although talin1 and talin2 share 76% protein sequence identity (88% similarity), they are not functionally redundant, and the differences between the two isoforms are not fully understood. In this Review, we focus on the similarities and differences between the two talins in terms of structure, biochemistry and function, which hint at subtle differences in fine-tuning adhesion signalling.",

A myriad of infectious agents mimic vinculin binding sites (VBS), enabling them to hijack the adhesion machinery and facilitate cellular entry. Here, we report the structural and biochemical characterisation of VBS from the chlamydial virulence factor TarP. Whilst the affinities of isolated VBS peptides from TarP and talin for vinculin are similar, their behaviour in larger fragments is markedly different. In talin, VBS are cryptic and require mechanical activation to bind vinculin, whereas the TarP VBS are located in disordered regions, and so are constitutively active. We demonstrate that the TarP VBS can uncouple talin:vinculin complexes, which may lead to adhesion destabilisation.",

This technique harnesses a promiscuous biotin ligase to biotinylate proteins based on proximity. The ligase is fused to a protein of interest and expressed in cells, where it biotinylates proximal endogenous proteins. Because it is a rare protein modification in nature, biotinylation of these endogenous proteins by BioID fusion proteins enables their selective isolation and identification with standard biotin-affinity capture. Proteins identified by BioID are candidate interactors for the protein of interest. BioID can be applied to insoluble proteins, can identify weak and/or transient interactions, and is amenable to temporal regulation. Initially applied to mammalian cells, BioID has potential application in a variety of cell types from diverse species. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

While this has led to many important results, these studies have been mainly limited to fast unfolding at a high-force regime due to the rapid mechanical drift in most AFM stretching experiments. Therefore, there is a gap between the knowledge obtained at a high-force regime and the mechanical properties of proteins at a lower force regime which is often more physiologically relevant. Recent studies have demonstrated that this gap can be addressed by stretching single protein molecules using magnetic tweezers, due to the excellent mechanical stability this technology offers. Here we review magnetic tweezers technology and its current application in studies of the force-dependent stability and interactions of proteins.",

The unfolding dynamics of titin immunoglobulin domains at a force range greater than 100 pN has been studied by atomic force microscopy, while that at smaller physiological forces has not been measured before. By using magnetic tweezers, it is found that the titin I27 domain unfolds in a surprising non-monotonic force-dependent manner at forces smaller than 100 pN, with the slowest unfolding rate occurring around 22 pN. We further demonstrate that a model with single unfolding pathway taking into account the elasticity of the transition state can reproduce the experimental results. These results provide important novel insights into the regulation mechanism of the passive elasticity of muscle tissues.",

Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5β and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.",

Here, we report the development and validation of a talin tension sensor. We find that talin in focal adhesions is under tension, which is higher in peripheral than central adhesions. Tension on talin is increased by vinculin and depends mainly on actin-binding site 2 (ABS2) within the middle of the rod domain, rather than ABS3 at the far C terminus. Unlike vinculin, talin is under lower tension on soft substrates. The difference between central and peripheral adhesions requires ABS3 but not vinculin or ABS2. However, differential stiffness sensing by talin requires ABS2 but not vinculin or ABS3. These results indicate that central versus peripheral adhesions must be organized and regulated differently, and that ABS2 and ABS3 have distinct functions in spatial variations and stiffness sensing. Overall, these results shed new light on talin function and constrain models for cellular mechanosensing.",

            "abstract": "The link between extracellular-matrix-bound integrins and intracellular F-actin is essential for cell spreading and migration. Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

            "abstract": "Cell and tissue stiffness have been known to contribute to both developmental and pathological signalling for some time, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Integrins and their associated adhesion signalling complexes (IACs), which form a nexus between the cell cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, act as a key force sensing and transducing unit in cells. Accordingly, there has been much interest in obtaining a systems-level understanding of IAC composition. Proteomic approaches have revealed the complexity of IACs and identified a large number of components that are regulated by cytoskeletal force. Here we review the function of the consensus adhesome, an assembly of core IAC proteins that emerged from a meta-analysis of multiple proteomic datasets, in the context of mechanosensing. As IAC components have been linked to a variety of diseases involved with rigidity sensing, the field is now in a position to define the mechanosensing function of individual IAC proteins and elucidate their mechanisms of action.",

Proteomic analyses of isolated IACs have revealed an unanticipated molecular complexity; however, a global view of the consensus composition and dynamics of IACs is lacking. Here, we have integrated several IAC proteomes and generated a 2,412-protein integrin adhesome. Analysis of this data set reveals the functional diversity of proteins in IACs and establishes a consensus adhesome of 60 proteins. The consensus adhesome is likely to represent a core cell adhesion machinery, centred around four axes comprising ILK-PINCH-kindlin, FAK-paxillin, talin-vinculin and α-actinin-zyxin-VASP, and includes underappreciated IAC components such as Rsu-1 and caldesmon. Proteomic quantification of IAC assembly and disassembly detailed the compositional dynamics of the core cell adhesion machinery. The definition of this consensus view of integrin adhesome components provides a resource for the research community. ",

            "abstract": "A fundamental question in mechanobiology is how mechanical stimuli are sensed by mechanosensing proteins and converted into signals that direct cells to adapt to the external environment. A key function of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is to transduce mechanical forces between cells and their extracellular environment. Talin, a cytoplasmic adapter essential for integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM, links the actin cytoskeleton to integrin at the plasma membrane. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of talin-dependent mechanosensing revealed by stretching single talin molecules. Rapid progress in single-molecule force manipulation technologies has made it possible to directly study the impact of mechanical force on talin's conformations and its interactions with other signaling proteins. We also provide our views on how findings from such studies may bring new insights into understanding the principles of mechanobiology on a broader scale, and how such fundamental knowledge may be harnessed for mechanopharmacology.",

An important aspect of such studies is to obtain the dynamics of interactions; however the initial binding is often difficult to obtain due to large mechanical perturbation during solution introduction. Here, we report a simple disturbance-free rapid solution exchange method for magnetic tweezers single-molecule manipulation experiments, which is achieved by tethering the molecules inside microwells (typical dimensions-diameter (D): 40-50 μm, height (H): 100 μm; H:D∼2:1). Our simulations and experiments show that the flow speed can be reduced by several orders of magnitude near the bottom of the microwells from that in the flow chamber, effectively eliminating the flow disturbance to molecules tethered in the microwells. We demonstrate a wide scope of applications of this method by measuring the force dependent DNA structural transitions in response to solution condition change, and polymerization dynamics of RecA on ssDNA/SSB-coated ssDNA/dsDNA of various tether lengths under constant forces, as well as the dynamics of vinculin binding to α-catenin at a constant force (< 5 pN) applied to the α-catenin protein.

It is the founding member of the CDK family and is conserved across all eukaryotes. Here we report the crystal structures of complexes of CDK1-Cks1 and CDK1-cyclin B-Cks2. These structures confirm the conserved nature of the inactive monomeric CDK fold and its ability to be remodelled by cyclin binding. Relative to CDK2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin B is less thermally stable, has a smaller interfacial surface, is more susceptible to activation segment dephosphorylation and shows differences in the substrate sequence features that determine activity. Both CDK1 and CDK2 are potential cancer targets for which selective compounds are required. We also describe the first structure of CDK1 bound to a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor and identify aspects of CDK1 structure and plasticity that might be exploited to develop CDK1-selective inhibitors.

Phosphorylation plays a major role in adhesion signalling; however, a full understanding of the phosphorylation events that occur at sites of adhesion is lacking. Here we report a proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of adhesion complexes isolated from cells spread on fibronectin. We identify 1,174 proteins, 499 of which are phosphorylated (1,109 phosphorylation sites), including both well-characterized and novel adhesion-regulated phosphorylation events. Immunoblotting suggests that two classes of phosphorylated residues are found at adhesion sites-those induced by adhesion and those constitutively phosphorylated but recruited in response to adhesion. Kinase prediction analysis identifies novel kinases with putative roles in adhesion signalling including CDK1, inhibition of which reduces adhesion complex formation. This phospho-adhesome data set constitutes a valuable resource to improve our understanding of the signalling mechanisms through which cell-ECM interactions control cell behaviour. ",

In addition, it encompasses tools to analyse the many additional experiments that make NMR such a pivotal technique for research into complex biological questions. This report describes how CcpNmr Analysis can seamlessly link together all of the tasks in the NMR structure-determination process. It details each of the stages from generating NMR restraints [distance, dihedral, hydrogen bonds and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs)], exporting these to and subsequently re-importing them from structure-calculation software (such as the programs CYANA or ARIA) and analysing and validating the results obtained from the structure calculation to, ultimately, the streamlined deposition of the completed assignments and the refined ensemble of structures into the PDBe repository. Until recently, such solution-structure determination by NMR has been quite a laborious task, requiring multiple stages and programs. However, with the new enhancements to CcpNmr Analysis described here, this process is now much more intuitive and efficient and less error-prone. ",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Cells entering mitosis become rounded, lose attachment to the substrate, and increase their cortical rigidity. Pivotal to these events is the dismantling of focal adhesions (FAs). How mitotic reshaping is linked to commitment to divide is unclear. Here, we show that DEPDC1B, a protein that accumulates in G2, coordinates de-adhesion events and cell-cycle progression at mitosis. DEPDC1B functions as an inhibitor of a RhoA-based signaling complex, which assembles on the FA-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, F (PTPRF) and mediates the integrity of FAs. By competing with RhoA for the interaction with PTPRF, DEPDC1B promotes the dismantling of FAs, which is necessary for the morphological changes preceding mitosis. The circuitry is relevant in whole organisms, as shown by the control exerted by the DEPDC1B/RhoA/PTPRF axis on mitotic dynamics during zebrafish development. Our results uncover an adhesion-dependent signaling mechanism that coordinates adhesion events with the control of cell-cycle progression. ",

LD motifs are required for embryogenesis, wound healing and the evolution of multicellularity. LD motifs also play roles in disease, such as in cancer metastasis or viral infection. First described in the paxillin family of scaffolding proteins, LD motifs and similar acidic LXXLL interaction motifs have been discovered in several other proteins, whereas 16 proteins have been reported to contain LDBDs (LD motif-binding domains). Collectively, structural and functional analyses have revealed a surprising multivalency in LD motif interactions and a wide diversity in LDBD architectures. In the present review, we summarize the molecular basis for function, regulation and selectivity of LD motif interactions that has emerged from more than a decade of research. This overview highlights the intricate multi-level regulation and the inherently noisy and heterogeneous nature of signalling through short protein-protein interaction motifs.",

This is true of most eukaryotic cells lacking a rigid cell wall and is observed in tissue culture and single-celled organisms, as well as in cells dividing inside tissues. While the mechanisms underlying this shape change are now well described, the functional importance of the spherical mitotic cell for the success of cell division has been thus far scarcely addressed. Here we discuss how mitotic rounding contributes to spindle assembly and positioning, as well as the potential consequences of abnormal mitotic cell shape and size on chromosome segregation, tissue growth, and cancer.

            "abstract": "Physical forces direct the orientation of the cell division axis for cells cultured on rigid, two-dimensional (2D) substrates. The extent to which physical forces regulate cell division in three-dimensional (3D) environments is not known. Here, we combine live-cell imaging with digital volume correlation to map 3D matrix displacements and identify sites at which cells apply contractile force to the matrix as they divide. Dividing cells embedded in fibrous matrices remained anchored to the matrix by long, thin protrusions. During cell rounding, the cells released adhesive contacts near the cell body while applying tensile forces at the tips of the protrusions to direct the orientation of the cell division axis. After cytokinesis, the daughter cells respread into matrix voids and invaded the matrix while maintaining traction forces at the tips of persistent and newly formed protrusions. Mechanical interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix constitute an important mechanism for regulation of cell division in 3D environments. ",

Analyzed tissues are usually collected without tight regulation or documentation of ischemic time. To evaluate the impact of ischemia, we collected human ovarian tumor and breast cancer xenograft tissue without vascular interruption and performed quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics after defined ischemic intervals. Although the global expressed proteome and most of the >25,000 quantified phosphosites were unchanged after 60 min, rapid phosphorylation changes were observed in up to 24% of the phosphoproteome, representing activation of critical cancer pathways related to stress response, transcriptional regulation, and cell death. Both pan-tumor and tissue-specific changes were observed. The demonstrated impact of pre-analytical tissue ischemia on tumor biology mandates caution in interpreting stress-pathway activation in such samples and motivates reexamination of collection protocols for phosphoprotein analysis.

Consequently, failure to establish functional cell adhesions, and thus the assembly of associated cytoplasmic scaffolding and signalling networks, can have severe pathological effects. The roles of specific constituents of integrin-mediated adhesions, which are collectively known as the 'integrin adhesome', in diverse pathological states are becoming clear. Indeed, the prominence of mutations in specific adhesome molecules in various human diseases is now appreciated, and experimental as well as in silico approaches provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological conditions.",

At the same time as the microtubule network is remodelled to generate a bipolar spindle, animal cells entering mitosis replace their interphase actin cytoskeleton with a contractile mitotic actomyosin cortex that is tightly coupled to the plasma membrane--driving mitotic cell rounding. Here, we consider how these two processes are coordinated to couple chromosome segregation and cell division. In doing so we explore the relative roles of cell shape and the actin cortex in spindle morphogenesis, orientation and positioning.",

            "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications. It plays key roles in regulating diverse biological processes of liver tissues. To better understand the role of protein phosphorylation in liver functions, it is essential to perform in-depth phosphoproteome analysis of human liver. Here, an enzyme assisted reversed-phase-reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-RPLC) approach with both RPLC separations operated with optimized acidic mobile phase was developed. High orthogonal separation was achieved by trypsin digestion of the Glu-C generated peptides in the fractions collected from the first RPLC separation. The phosphoproteome coverage was further improved by using two types of instruments, i.e. TripleTOF 5600 and LTQ Orbitrap Velos. A total of 22,446 phosphorylation sites, corresponding to 6526 nonredundant phosphoproteins were finally identified from normal human liver tissues. Of these sites, 15,229 sites were confidently localized with Ascore≥13. This dataset was the largest phosphoproteome dataset of human liver. It can be a public resource for the liver research community and holds promise for further biology studies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The enzyme assisted approach enabled the two RPLC separations operated both with optimized acidic mobile phases. The identifications from TripleTOF 5600 and Orbitrap Velos are highly complementary. The largest phosphoproteome dataset of human liver was generated.",

Clarifying the underlying mechanisms and cellular contexts of Cks function is critical because Cks is essential for proper cell growth, and its overexpression has been linked to cancer. We observe that budding-yeast Cks associates with select phosphorylated sequences in cell cycle-regulatory proteins. We characterize the molecular interactions responsible for this specificity and demonstrate that Cks enhances CDK activity in response to specific priming phosphosites. Identification of the binding consensus sequence allows us to identify putative Cks-directed CDK substrates and binding partners. We characterize new Cks-binding sites in the mitotic regulator Wee1 and discover a new role for Cks in regulating CDK activity at mitotic entry. Together, our results portray Cks as a multifunctional phosphoadaptor that serves as a specificity factor for CDK activity. ",

Close cooperation between this trio is necessary for ensuring orderly progression through the cell cycle. In addition to their well-established function in cell cycle control, it is becoming increasingly apparent that mammalian Cdks, cyclins and CKIs play indispensable roles in processes such as transcription, epigenetic regulation, metabolism, stem cell self-renewal, neuronal functions and spermatogenesis. Even more remarkably, they can accomplish some of these tasks individually, without the need for Cdk/cyclin complex formation or kinase activity. In this Review, we discuss the latest revelations about Cdks, cyclins and CKIs with the goal of showcasing their functional diversity beyond cell cycle regulation and their impact on development and disease in mammals.

            "abstract": "Accurate animal cell division requires precise coordination of changes in the structure of the microtubule-based spindle and the actin-based cell cortex. Here, we use a series of perturbation experiments to dissect the relative roles of actin, cortical mechanics, and cell shape in spindle formation. We find that, whereas the actin cortex is largely dispensable for rounding and timely mitotic progression in isolated cells, it is needed to drive rounding to enable unperturbed spindle morphogenesis under conditions of confinement. Using different methods to limit mitotic cell height, we show that a failure to round up causes defects in spindle assembly, pole splitting, and a delay in mitotic progression. These defects can be rescued by increasing microtubule lengths and therefore appear to be a direct consequence of the limited reach of mitotic centrosome-nucleated microtubules. These findings help to explain why most animal cells round up as they enter mitosis.",

            "abstract": "Talin activates integrins, couples them to F-actin, and recruits vinculin to focal adhesions (FAs). Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

Dividing animal cells first ingress a cytokinetic furrow and then separate the plasma membrane by abscission. The general cytological events and several conserved molecular factors involved in cytokinesis have been known for many years. However, recent progress in microscopy, chemical genetics, biochemical reconstitution and biophysical methodology has tremendously increased our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We discuss how recent insights have led to refined models of the distinct steps of animal cell cytokinesis, including anaphase spindle reorganization, division plane specification, actomyosin ring assembly and contraction, and abscission. We highlight how molecular signalling pathways coordinate the individual events to ensure faithful partitioning of the genome to emerging daughter cells.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a new technique for proximity-dependent labeling of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Named BioID for proximity-dependent biotin identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.",

            "abstract": "Protein interactions with peptides generally have low thermodynamic and mechanical stability. Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys and Asp. By splitting this domain and rational engineering of the fragments, we obtained a peptide (SpyTag) which formed an amide bond to its protein partner (SpyCatcher) in minutes. Reaction occurred in high yield simply upon mixing and amidst diverse conditions of pH, temperature, and buffer. SpyTag could be fused at either terminus or internally and reacted specifically at the mammalian cell surface. Peptide binding was not reversed by boiling or competing peptide. Single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy showed that SpyTag did not separate from SpyCatcher until the force exceeded 1 nN, where covalent bonds snap. The robust reaction conditions and irreversible linkage of SpyTag shed light on spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and should provide a targetable lock in cells and a stable module for new protein architectures.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.",

Here, we report the first structure of talin bound to an authentic full-length beta integrin tail. Using biophysical and whole cell measurements, we show that a specific ionic interaction between the talin F3 domain and the membrane-proximal helix of the beta tail disrupts an integrin alpha/beta salt bridge that helps maintain the integrin inactive state. Second, we identify a positively charged surface on the talin F2 domain that precisely orients talin to disrupt the heterodimeric integrin transmembrane (TM) complex. These results show key structural features that explain the ability of talin to mediate inside-out TM signalling.",

            "abstract": "The binding of integrin adhesion receptors to their extracellular matrix ligands controls cell morphology, movement, survival, and differentiation in various developmental, homeostatic, and disease processes. Here, we report a methodology to isolate complexes associated with integrin adhesion receptors, which, like other receptor-associated signaling complexes, have been refractory to proteomic analysis. Quantitative, comparative analyses of the proteomes of two receptor-ligand pairs, alpha(4)beta(1)-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and alpha(5)beta(1)-fibronectin, defined both core and receptor-specific components. Regulator of chromosome condensation-2 (RCC2) was detected in the alpha(5)beta(1)-fibronectin signaling network at an intersection between the Rac1 and adenosine 5'-diphosphate ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) subnetworks. RCC2 knockdown enhanced fibronectin-induced activation of both Rac1 and Arf6 and accelerated cell spreading, suggesting that RCC2 limits the signaling required for membrane protrusion and delivery. Dysregulation of Rac1 and Arf6 function by RCC2 knockdown also abolished persistent migration along fibronectin fibers, indicating a functional role for RCC2 in directional cell movement. This proteomics workflow now opens the way to further dissection and systems-level analyses of adhesion signaling.",

            "abstract": "At the onset of mitosis, most adherent cells undergo cell retraction characterised by the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres. Mitosis takes place in rounded cells, and the two daughter cells spread again after cytokinesis. Because of the well-documented ability of the small GTPase Rap1 to stimulate integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading, we assessed its role during mitosis. We show that Rap1 activity is regulated during this process. Changes in Rap1 activity play an essential role in regulating cell retraction and spreading, respectively, before and after mitosis of HeLa cells. Indeed, endogenous Rap1 is inhibited at the onset of mitosis; conversely, constitutive activation of Rap1 inhibits the disassembly of premitotic focal adhesions and of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to delayed mitosis and to cytokinesis defects. Rap1 activity slowly increases after mitosis ends; inhibition of Rap1 activation by the ectopic expression of the dominant-negative Rap1[S17A] mutant prevents the rounded cells from spreading after mitosis. For the first time, we provide evidence for the direct regulation of adhesion processes during mitosis via the activity of the Rap1 GTPase.",

The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "The orientation of mitotic spindles, which determines the plane of cell division, is tightly regulated in polarized cells such as epithelial cells, but it has been unclear whether there is a mechanism regulating spindle orientation in non-polarized cultured cells. In adherent cultured cells, spindles are positioned at the center of the cells and the axis of the spindle lies in the longest axis of the cell. Thus, cell geometry is thought to be one of cues for spindle orientation and positioning in cultured cells because this defines the center and the long axis of the cell. Recent work provides a new insight into the spindle orientation in cultured cells; spindles are aligned along the axis parallel to the cell-substrate adhesion plane. Concomitantly, integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), rather than gravitation, cell-cell adhesion or cell geometry, has shown to be essential for this mechanism of spindle orientation. Several independent lines of evidence confirm the involvement of cell-ECM adhesion in spindle orientation in both cultured cells and in developing organisms. The important future challenge is to identify a molecular mechanism(s) that links integrin and spindles in the control of spindle axis.",

The positioning of the division axis has been mostly studied in systems such as embryos or yeasts, in which cell shape is well defined. In these cases, cell shape anisotropy and cell polarity affect spindle orientation. It remains unclear whether cell geometry or cortical cues are determinants for spindle orientation in mammalian cultured cells. The cell environment is composed of an extracellular matrix (ECM), which is connected to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton via transmembrane proteins. We used micro-contact printing to control the spatial distribution of the ECM on the substrate and demonstrated that it has a role in determining the orientation of the division axis of HeLa cells. On the basis of our analysis of the average distributions of actin-binding proteins in interphase and mitosis, we propose that the ECM controls the location of actin dynamics at the membrane, and thus the segregation of cortical components in interphase. This segregation is further maintained on the cortex of mitotic cells and used for spindle orientation.",

The interaction of LD motifs with their targets plays an important role in the assembly of FAs. We have determined the molecular basis for the recognition of two paxillin LD motifs by the FA targeting (FAT) domain of FA kinase using a combination of X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and homology modeling. The four-helix FAT domain displays two LD binding sites on opposite sites of the molecule that bind LD peptides in a helical conformation. Threading studies suggest that the LD-interacting domain of p95PKL shares a common four-helical core with the FAT domain and the tail of vinculin, defining a structural family of LD motif binding modules.",

            "abstract": "Control of integrin affinity for ligands (integrin activation) is essential for normal cell adhesion, migration, and assembly of an extracellular matrix. Integrin activation is usually mediated through the integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tail and can be regulated by many different biochemical signaling pathways. We report that specific binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tails leads to the conformational rearrangements of integrin extracellular domains that increase their affinity. Thus, regulated binding of talin to integrin beta tails is a final common element of cellular signaling cascades that control integrin activation.",

Here we report the crystal structure of the principal integrin binding and activating fragment of talin, alone and in complex with fragments of the beta 3 integrin tail. The FERM (four point one, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain of talin engages integrins via a novel variant of the canonical phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-NPxY ligand interaction that may be a prototype for FERM domain recognition of transmembrane receptors. In combination with NMR and mutational analysis, our studies reveal the critical interacting elements of both talin and the integrin beta 3 tail, providing structural paradigms for integrin linkage to the cell interior.",

The cytoplasmic protein, talin, binds to beta integrin cytoplasmic tails and actin filaments, hence forming an integrin-cytoskeletal linkage. We used recombinant structural mimics of beta(1)A, beta(1)D and beta(3) integrin cytoplasmic tails to characterize integrin-binding sites within talin. Here we report that an integrin-binding site is localized within the N-terminal talin head domain. The binding of the talin head domain to integrin beta tails is specific in that it is abrogated by a single point mutation that disrupts integrin localization to talin-rich focal adhesions. Integrin-cytoskeletal interactions regulate integrin affinity for ligands (activation). Overexpression of a fragment of talin containing the head domain led to activation of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3); activation was dependent on the presence of both the talin head domain and the integrin beta(3) cytoplasmic tail. The head domain of talin thus binds to integrins to form a link to the actin cytoskeleton and can thus regulate integrin function.",

            "abstract": "The loss of integrin-mediated cell-matrix contact induces apoptosis ('anoikis') in certain cell types. Recently it has been shown that protein kinase signaling pathways control anoikis both positively and negatively. Focal adhesion kinase, when activated by integrins, can suppress anoikis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the AKT oncoprotein may mediate the anoikis-suppressing effects of focal adhesion kinase. Conversely, the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway promotes anoikis. Latest results indicate that caspase-mediated cleavage of the first component of this latter pathway, MEKK-1, may trigger activation of this pathway in anoikis. In addition, certain integrins may regulate bcl-2 expression levels, possibly adjusting the threshold for anoikis.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an actin-binding protein involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. The C-terminal 197 amino acids of vertebrate talin are 45% similar to the C-terminal residues of Sla2, a yeast protein implicated in polarized assembly of the yeast actin cytoskeleton. Talin is also homologous in this region to nematode talin, cellular slime mold filopodin, and an Sla2 homolog from nematode. Analysis of the conserved C-terminal sequences of these five proteins with BLOCK MAKER reveals a series of four blocks, which we name the I/LWEQ module after the conserved initial residues in each block. Experiments presented here show that the conserved protein domain represented by the I/LWEQ module competes quantitatively with native talin for binding to F-actin in vitro. Furthermore, the corresponding domain of Sla2 binds to both yeast and vertebrate F-actin in vitro. Mutation of one of the conserved residues in the fourth conserved block abolishes the interaction of the Sla2 I/LWEQ module with F-actin. These results establish the location of an F-actin binding domain in native talin, demonstrate that direct interaction of Sla2 with actin is a possible basis for its effect on the actin cytoskeleton in vivo, and define the I/LWEQ consensus as a new actin-binding motif.",

            "abstract": "We have determined the sequence of chicken talin (2,541 amino acids, M(r) 271,881) which is very similar (89% identity) to that of the mouse protein. Alignments with the Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum talin sequences show that the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein are conserved whereas the central part of the molecule is more divergent. By expressing overlapping talin polypeptides as fusion proteins, we have identified at least three regions of the protein which can bind F-actin: residues 102-497, 951-1,327 and 2,269-2,541. The N-terminal binding site contains a region with homology to the ERM family of actin-binding proteins, and the C-terminal site is homologous to the yeast actin-binding protein Sla2p. Each of the actin-binding sites is close to, but distinct from a binding site for vinculin, a protein which also binds actin. The Pro1176 to Thr substitution found in talin from Wistar-Furth rats does not destroy the capacity of this region of the protein to bind actin or vinculin. Microinjection studies showed that a fusion protein containing the N-terminal actin-binding site localised weakly to stress fibres, whereas one containing the C-terminal site initially localised predominantly to focal adhesions. The former was readily solubilised, and the latter was resistant to Triton extraction. The N-terminal talin polypeptide eventually disrupted actin stress fibres whereas the C-terminal polypeptide was without effect. However, a larger C-terminal fusion protein also containing a vinculin-binding site did disrupt stress fibres and focal adhesions. The results suggest that, although both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin bind actin, the properties of these two regions of the protein are distinct.",

In many cases, PCD is induced by the withdrawal of specific hormones or growth factors that function as survival factors. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a cell survival factor. Our results indicate that in the absence of any ECM interactions, human endothelial cells rapidly undergo PCD, as determined by cell morphology, nuclei fragmentation, DNA degradation, protein cross-linking, and the expression of the PCD-specific gene TRPM-2. PCD was blocked by plating cells on an immobilized integrin beta 1 antibody but not by antibodies to either the class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), suggesting that integrin-mediated signals were required for maintaining cell viability. Treatment of the cells in suspension with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate also blocked PCD. When other cell types were examined, some, but not all, underwent rapid cell death when deprived of adhesion to the ECM. These results suggest that in addition to regulating cell growth and differentiation, the ECM also functions as a survival factor for many cell types.",

            "abstract": "The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are activated by association with cyclins and by phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). We have studied the binding of various human CDK and cyclin subunits in vitro, using purified proteins derived from baculovirus-infected insect cells. We find that most CDK-cyclin complexes known to exist in human cells (CDC2-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK2-cyclin E) form with high affinity in the absence of phosphorylation or other cellular components. One complex (CDC2-cyclin A) forms with high affinity only after CAK-mediated phosphorylation of CDC2 at the activating threonine residue. CDC2 does not bind with high affinity to cyclin E in vitro, even after phosphorylation of the CDC2 subunit. Thus, phosphorylation is of varying importance in the formation of high-affinity CDK-cyclin complexes.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, is exquisitely sensitive to biochemical, structural, and mechanical features of the ECM. Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Talin has emerged as the key cytoplasmic protein that mediates integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix. In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large (∼2540 residues) dimeric adaptor protein that associates with the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules in cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), where it both activates integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. Calpain2-mediated cleavage of talin between the head and rod domains has previously been shown to be important in FA turnover. Here we identify an additional calpain2-cleavage site that removes the dimerisation domain from the C-terminus of the talin rod, and show that an E2492G mutation inhibits calpain cleavage at this site in vitro, and increases the steady state levels of talin1 in vivo. Expression of a GFP-tagged talin1 E2492G mutant in CHO.K1 cells inhibited FA turnover and the persistence of cell protrusion just as effectively as a L432G mutation that inhibits calpain cleavage between the talin head and rod domains. Moreover, incorporation of both mutations into a single talin molecule had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that calpain cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin contribute to the regulation of FA dynamics. However, the N-terminal site was more sensitive to calpain cleavage suggesting that lower levels of calpain are required to liberate the talin head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the C-terminal dimerisation domain. The talin head and rod liberated by calpain2 cleavage have recently been shown to play roles in an integrin activation cycle important in FA turnover and in FAK-dependent cell cycle progression respectively. The half-life of the talin head is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and we suggest that removal of the C-terminal dimerisation domain from the talin rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the signalling function of the talin rod and indeed for inactivating full-length talin thereby promoting FA turnover at the rear of the cell.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric αβ integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.",

The head domain binds integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, which triggers integrin conformational activation to increase affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. The rod domain links to actin filaments inside the cell to transmit mechanical loads and serves as a mechanosensitive signalling hub for the recruitment of many other proteins. The α-helical bundles function as force-dependent switches - proteins that interact with folded bundles are displaced when force induces unfolding, exposing previously cryptic binding sites for other ligands. This leads to the notion of a talin code. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we propose that the multiple switches within the talin rod function to process and store time- and force-dependent mechanical and chemical information.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a ubiquitous, large focal adhesion protein that links intracellular networks with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via its connection with the actin cytoskeleton and membrane integrins. It is one of a handful molecules that can expose new recognition sites when undergoing force-induced mechanical unfolding, and it can bind and recruit cytoskeletal proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction. Talin has attracted great interest in the field of mechanobiology because of its plasticity in undergoing conformational changes under force stimulation as well as its cellular localization that bridges the cytoskeleton with the ECM. In addition to these roles in healthy cells, the dysregulation of talin activators can lead to disease states in which aberrant integrin activation and mechanotransduction precipitate changes in cell spreading, migration, and survival. New data have implicated a role for talin in diseases that are highly regulated by mechanical cues. In this review, we present the current understanding of talin structure, its relationship to binding partners, and its role in disease states.-Haining, A. W. M., Lieberthal, T.

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent adhesion sites consist of clustered integrins that transmit mechanical forces and provide signaling required for cell survival and morphogenesis. Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.",

            "abstract": "Leukocyte integrins of the beta2 family are essential for immune cell-cell adhesion. In activated cells, beta2 integrins are phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic Thr758, leading to 14-3-3 protein recruitment to the beta2 integrin. The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which provides a direct link between integrins and actin filaments, has been shown to contain two distinct binding sites for integrin beta subunits. Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984-2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with beta(3)-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant beta(3) cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between beta(3)-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984-2113) that also localized to focal adhesions. Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for beta(3)-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation.",

            "abstract": "Talin1 is a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to actin filaments through two distinct integrin binding sites, one present in the talin head domain (IBS1) necessary for integrin activation and a second (IBS2) that we have previously mapped to talin residues 1984-2113 (fragment J) of the talin rod domain (1 Tremuth, L., Kreis, S., Melchior, C., Hoebeke, J., Ronde, P., Plancon, S., Takeda, K., and Kieffer, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in alpha helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this alpha helix, which disrupted the alpha-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an alphaIIbbeta3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1(-/-) cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/Cux(Cdc6) mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Three vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) have previously been identified in the talin rod using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To extend these studies, we spot-synthesized a series of peptides spanning all the alpha-helical regions predicted for the talin rod and identified eight additional VBSs, two of which overlap key functional regions of the rod, including the integrin binding site and C-terminal actin binding site. The talin VBS alpha-helices bind to a hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminal vinculin Vd1 domain. We have defined the specificity of this interaction by spot-synthesizing a series of 25-mer talin VBS1 peptides containing substitutions with all the commonly occurring amino acids. The consensus for recognition is LXXAAXXVAXX- VXXLIXXA with distinct classes of hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16 required for vinculin binding. Positions 1, 8, 12, 15, and 16 require an aliphatic residue and will not tolerate alanine, whereas positions 4, 5, and 9 are less restrictive. These preferences are common to all 11 VBS sequences with a minor variation occurring in one case. A crystal structure of this variant VBS peptide in complex with the vinculin Vd1 domain reveals a subtly different mode of vinculin binding.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E. (1992) Cell 71, 891-894; Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP450, but dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.",

            "abstract": "Transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, mediate cell adhesion by interacting with intracellular proteins that connect to the cytoskeleton. Talin, one such linker protein, is thought to have two roles: mediating inside-out activation of integrins, and connecting extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin's amino-terminal head, which consists of a FERM domain, binds an NPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of most integrin beta subunits. This is consistent with the role of FERM domains in recruiting other proteins to the plasma membrane. We tested the role of the talin-head-NPxY interaction in integrin function in Drosophila. We found that introduction of a mutation that perturbs this binding in vitro into the isolated talin head disrupts its recruitment by integrins in vivo. Surprisingly, when engineered into the full-length talin, this mutation did not disrupt talin recruitment by integrins nor its ability to connect integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, it reduced the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM, indicating that the function of the talin-head-NPxY interaction is solely to regulate integrin adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain comprised of F1, F2 and F3 domains, but it is atypical in that F1 contains a large insert and is preceded by an extra domain F0. Although F3 contains the binding site for beta-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of beta1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of beta1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.",

In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction from the extracellular matrix into the cell is primarily supervised by a transmembrane receptor, integrin, and a cytosolic protein, talin. Integrin binds ligands on the extracellular side, whereas talin couples integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and later acts as a \"force buffer\". Talin and integrin together form a mechanosensitive signaling hub that regulates crucial cellular processes and pathways, including cell signaling and formation of focal adhesion complexes, which help cells to sense their mechano-environment and transduce the signal accordingly. Although both proteins function in tandem, most literature focuses on them individually. Here, we provide a focused review of the talin-integrin mechano-interactome network in light of its role in the process of mechanotransduction and its connection to diseases. While working under force, these proteins drive numerous biomolecular interactions and form adhesion complexes, which in turn control many physiological processes such as cell migration; thus, they are invariably associated with several diseases from leukocyte adhesion deficiency to cancer. Gaining insights into their role in the occurrence of these pathological disorders might lead us to establish treatment methods and therapeutic techniques.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication. ",

            "abstract": "Cdk specificity is determined by the intrinsic selectivity of the active site and by substrate docking sites on the cyclin subunit. There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Following platelet aggregation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) becomes associated with the platelet cytoskeleton. The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "Talin1 is a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to actin filaments through two distinct integrin binding sites, one present in the talin head domain (IBS1) necessary for integrin activation and a second (IBS2) that we have previously mapped to talin residues 1984-2113 (fragment J) of the talin rod domain (1 Tremuth, L., Kreis, S., Melchior, C., Hoebeke, J., Ronde, P., Plancon, S., Takeda, K., and Kieffer, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in alpha helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this alpha helix, which disrupted the alpha-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an alphaIIbbeta3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1(-/-) cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Previous experiments with peptide fusion proteins suggested that cyclin A/Cdk1 and Cdk2 might exhibit similar yet distinct phosphorylation specificities. Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/Cux(Cdc6) mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain comprised of F1, F2 and F3 domains, but it is atypical in that F1 contains a large insert and is preceded by an extra domain F0. Although F3 contains the binding site for beta-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of beta1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of beta1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Leukocyte integrins of the beta2 family are essential for immune cell-cell adhesion. In activated cells, beta2 integrins are phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic Thr758, leading to 14-3-3 protein recruitment to the beta2 integrin. The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP450, but dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes.

Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a ubiquitous, large focal adhesion protein that links intracellular networks with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via its connection with the actin cytoskeleton and membrane integrins. It is one of a handful molecules that can expose new recognition sites when undergoing force-induced mechanical unfolding, and it can bind and recruit cytoskeletal proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction. Talin has attracted great interest in the field of mechanobiology because of its plasticity in undergoing conformational changes under force stimulation as well as its cellular localization that bridges the cytoskeleton with the ECM. In addition to these roles in healthy cells, the dysregulation of talin activators can lead to disease states in which aberrant integrin activation and mechanotransduction precipitate changes in cell spreading, migration, and survival. New data have implicated a role for talin in diseases that are highly regulated by mechanical cues. In this review, we present the current understanding of talin structure, its relationship to binding partners, and its role in disease states.-Haining, A. W. M., Lieberthal, T.

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction from the extracellular matrix into the cell is primarily supervised by a transmembrane receptor, integrin, and a cytosolic protein, talin. Integrin binds ligands on the extracellular side, whereas talin couples integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and later acts as a \"force buffer\". Talin and integrin together form a mechanosensitive signaling hub that regulates crucial cellular processes and pathways, including cell signaling and formation of focal adhesion complexes, which help cells to sense their mechano-environment and transduce the signal accordingly. Although both proteins function in tandem, most literature focuses on them individually. Here, we provide a focused review of the talin-integrin mechano-interactome network in light of its role in the process of mechanotransduction and its connection to diseases. While working under force, these proteins drive numerous biomolecular interactions and form adhesion complexes, which in turn control many physiological processes such as cell migration; thus, they are invariably associated with several diseases from leukocyte adhesion deficiency to cancer. Gaining insights into their role in the occurrence of these pathological disorders might lead us to establish treatment methods and therapeutic techniques.",

            "abstract": "The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication. ",

Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

            "abstract": "Transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, mediate cell adhesion by interacting with intracellular proteins that connect to the cytoskeleton. Talin, one such linker protein, is thought to have two roles: mediating inside-out activation of integrins, and connecting extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin's amino-terminal head, which consists of a FERM domain, binds an NPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of most integrin beta subunits. This is consistent with the role of FERM domains in recruiting other proteins to the plasma membrane. We tested the role of the talin-head-NPxY interaction in integrin function in Drosophila. We found that introduction of a mutation that perturbs this binding in vitro into the isolated talin head disrupts its recruitment by integrins in vivo. Surprisingly, when engineered into the full-length talin, this mutation did not disrupt talin recruitment by integrins nor its ability to connect integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, it reduced the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM, indicating that the function of the talin-head-NPxY interaction is solely to regulate integrin adhesion.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which provides a direct link between integrins and actin filaments, has been shown to contain two distinct binding sites for integrin beta subunits. Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984-2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with beta(3)-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant beta(3) cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between beta(3)-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984-2113) that also localized to focal adhesions. Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for beta(3)-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.",

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Three vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) have previously been identified in the talin rod using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To extend these studies, we spot-synthesized a series of peptides spanning all the alpha-helical regions predicted for the talin rod and identified eight additional VBSs, two of which overlap key functional regions of the rod, including the integrin binding site and C-terminal actin binding site. The talin VBS alpha-helices bind to a hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminal vinculin Vd1 domain. We have defined the specificity of this interaction by spot-synthesizing a series of 25-mer talin VBS1 peptides containing substitutions with all the commonly occurring amino acids. The consensus for recognition is LXXAAXXVAXX- VXXLIXXA with distinct classes of hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16 required for vinculin binding. Positions 1, 8, 12, 15, and 16 require an aliphatic residue and will not tolerate alanine, whereas positions 4, 5, and 9 are less restrictive. These preferences are common to all 11 VBS sequences with a minor variation occurring in one case. A crystal structure of this variant VBS peptide in complex with the vinculin Vd1 domain reveals a subtly different mode of vinculin binding.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

The head domain binds integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, which triggers integrin conformational activation to increase affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. The rod domain links to actin filaments inside the cell to transmit mechanical loads and serves as a mechanosensitive signalling hub for the recruitment of many other proteins. The α-helical bundles function as force-dependent switches - proteins that interact with folded bundles are displaced when force induces unfolding, exposing previously cryptic binding sites for other ligands. This leads to the notion of a talin code.

            "abstract": "Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric αβ integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E. (1992) Cell 71, 891-894; Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large (∼2540 residues) dimeric adaptor protein that associates with the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules in cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), where it both activates integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. Calpain2-mediated cleavage of talin between the head and rod domains has previously been shown to be important in FA turnover. Here we identify an additional calpain2-cleavage site that removes the dimerisation domain from the C-terminus of the talin rod, and show that an E2492G mutation inhibits calpain cleavage at this site in vitro, and increases the steady state levels of talin1 in vivo. Expression of a GFP-tagged talin1 E2492G mutant in CHO.K1 cells inhibited FA turnover and the persistence of cell protrusion just as effectively as a L432G mutation that inhibits calpain cleavage between the talin head and rod domains. Moreover, incorporation of both mutations into a single talin molecule had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that calpain cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin contribute to the regulation of FA dynamics. However, the N-terminal site was more sensitive to calpain cleavage suggesting that lower levels of calpain are required to liberate the talin head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the C-terminal dimerisation domain. The talin head and rod liberated by calpain2 cleavage have recently been shown to play roles in an integrin activation cycle important in FA turnover and in FAK-dependent cell cycle progression respectively. The half-life of the talin head is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and we suggest that removal of the C-terminal dimerisation domain from the talin rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the signalling function of the talin rod and indeed for inactivating full-length talin thereby promoting FA turnover at the rear of the cell.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Following platelet aggregation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) becomes associated with the platelet cytoskeleton. The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Three vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) have previously been identified in the talin rod using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To extend these studies, we spot-synthesized a series of peptides spanning all the alpha-helical regions predicted for the talin rod and identified eight additional VBSs, two of which overlap key functional regions of the rod, including the integrin binding site and C-terminal actin binding site. The talin VBS alpha-helices bind to a hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminal vinculin Vd1 domain. We have defined the specificity of this interaction by spot-synthesizing a series of 25-mer talin VBS1 peptides containing substitutions with all the commonly occurring amino acids. The consensus for recognition is LXXAAXXVAXX- VXXLIXXA with distinct classes of hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16 required for vinculin binding. Positions 1, 8, 12, 15, and 16 require an aliphatic residue and will not tolerate alanine, whereas positions 4, 5, and 9 are less restrictive. These preferences are common to all 11 VBS sequences with a minor variation occurring in one case. A crystal structure of this variant VBS peptide in complex with the vinculin Vd1 domain reveals a subtly different mode of vinculin binding.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E. (1992) Cell 71, 891-894; Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.",

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction from the extracellular matrix into the cell is primarily supervised by a transmembrane receptor, integrin, and a cytosolic protein, talin. Integrin binds ligands on the extracellular side, whereas talin couples integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and later acts as a \"force buffer\". Talin and integrin together form a mechanosensitive signaling hub that regulates crucial cellular processes and pathways, including cell signaling and formation of focal adhesion complexes, which help cells to sense their mechano-environment and transduce the signal accordingly. Although both proteins function in tandem, most literature focuses on them individually. Here, we provide a focused review of the talin-integrin mechano-interactome network in light of its role in the process of mechanotransduction and its connection to diseases. While working under force, these proteins drive numerous biomolecular interactions and form adhesion complexes, which in turn control many physiological processes such as cell migration; thus, they are invariably associated with several diseases from leukocyte adhesion deficiency to cancer. Gaining insights into their role in the occurrence of these pathological disorders might lead us to establish treatment methods and therapeutic techniques.",

Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984-2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with beta(3)-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant beta(3) cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between beta(3)-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984-2113) that also localized to focal adhesions. Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for beta(3)-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation.",

Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large (∼2540 residues) dimeric adaptor protein that associates with the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules in cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), where it both activates integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. Calpain2-mediated cleavage of talin between the head and rod domains has previously been shown to be important in FA turnover. Here we identify an additional calpain2-cleavage site that removes the dimerisation domain from the C-terminus of the talin rod, and show that an E2492G mutation inhibits calpain cleavage at this site in vitro, and increases the steady state levels of talin1 in vivo. Expression of a GFP-tagged talin1 E2492G mutant in CHO.K1 cells inhibited FA turnover and the persistence of cell protrusion just as effectively as a L432G mutation that inhibits calpain cleavage between the talin head and rod domains. Moreover, incorporation of both mutations into a single talin molecule had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that calpain cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin contribute to the regulation of FA dynamics. However, the N-terminal site was more sensitive to calpain cleavage suggesting that lower levels of calpain are required to liberate the talin head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the C-terminal dimerisation domain. The talin head and rod liberated by calpain2 cleavage have recently been shown to play roles in an integrin activation cycle important in FA turnover and in FAK-dependent cell cycle progression respectively. The half-life of the talin head is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and we suggest that removal of the C-terminal dimerisation domain from the talin rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the signalling function of the talin rod and indeed for inactivating full-length talin thereby promoting FA turnover at the rear of the cell.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

The head domain binds integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, which triggers integrin conformational activation to increase affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. The rod domain links to actin filaments inside the cell to transmit mechanical loads and serves as a mechanosensitive signalling hub for the recruitment of many other proteins. The α-helical bundles function as force-dependent switches - proteins that interact with folded bundles are displaced when force induces unfolding, exposing previously cryptic binding sites for other ligands. This leads to the notion of a talin code. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we propose that the multiple switches within the talin rod function to process and store time- and force-dependent mechanical and chemical information.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP450, but dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.",

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.",

            "abstract": "The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication. ",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain comprised of F1, F2 and F3 domains, but it is atypical in that F1 contains a large insert and is preceded by an extra domain F0. Although F3 contains the binding site for beta-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of beta1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of beta1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric αβ integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Leukocyte integrins of the beta2 family are essential for immune cell-cell adhesion. In activated cells, beta2 integrins are phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic Thr758, leading to 14-3-3 protein recruitment to the beta2 integrin. The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent adhesion sites consist of clustered integrins that transmit mechanical forces and provide signaling required for cell survival and morphogenesis. Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "Talin1 is a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to actin filaments through two distinct integrin binding sites, one present in the talin head domain (IBS1) necessary for integrin activation and a second (IBS2) that we have previously mapped to talin residues 1984-2113 (fragment J) of the talin rod domain (1 Tremuth, L., Kreis, S., Melchior, C., Hoebeke, J., Ronde, P., Plancon, S., Takeda, K., and Kieffer, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in alpha helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this alpha helix, which disrupted the alpha-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an alphaIIbbeta3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1(-/-) cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.",

There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.",

Talin, one such linker protein, is thought to have two roles: mediating inside-out activation of integrins, and connecting extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin's amino-terminal head, which consists of a FERM domain, binds an NPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of most integrin beta subunits. This is consistent with the role of FERM domains in recruiting other proteins to the plasma membrane. We tested the role of the talin-head-NPxY interaction in integrin function in Drosophila. We found that introduction of a mutation that perturbs this binding in vitro into the isolated talin head disrupts its recruitment by integrins in vivo. Surprisingly, when engineered into the full-length talin, this mutation did not disrupt talin recruitment by integrins nor its ability to connect integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, it reduced the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM, indicating that the function of the talin-head-NPxY interaction is solely to regulate integrin adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a ubiquitous, large focal adhesion protein that links intracellular networks with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via its connection with the actin cytoskeleton and membrane integrins. It is one of a handful molecules that can expose new recognition sites when undergoing force-induced mechanical unfolding, and it can bind and recruit cytoskeletal proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction. Talin has attracted great interest in the field of mechanobiology because of its plasticity in undergoing conformational changes under force stimulation as well as its cellular localization that bridges the cytoskeleton with the ECM. In addition to these roles in healthy cells, the dysregulation of talin activators can lead to disease states in which aberrant integrin activation and mechanotransduction precipitate changes in cell spreading, migration, and survival. New data have implicated a role for talin in diseases that are highly regulated by mechanical cues. In this review, we present the current understanding of talin structure, its relationship to binding partners, and its role in disease states.-Haining, A. W. M., Lieberthal, T. J., del Río Hernández, A. Talin: a mechanosensitive molecule in health and disease.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are protein machineries essential for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

            "abstract": "Previous experiments with peptide fusion proteins suggested that cyclin A/Cdk1 and Cdk2 might exhibit similar yet distinct phosphorylation specificities. Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/Cux(Cdc6) mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which provides a direct link between integrins and actin filaments, has been shown to contain two distinct binding sites for integrin beta subunits. Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984-2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with beta(3)-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant beta(3) cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between beta(3)-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984-2113) that also localized to focal adhesions. Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for beta(3)-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation.",

            "abstract": "Following platelet aggregation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) becomes associated with the platelet cytoskeleton. The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction from the extracellular matrix into the cell is primarily supervised by a transmembrane receptor, integrin, and a cytosolic protein, talin. Integrin binds ligands on the extracellular side, whereas talin couples integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and later acts as a \"force buffer\". Talin and integrin together form a mechanosensitive signaling hub that regulates crucial cellular processes and pathways, including cell signaling and formation of focal adhesion complexes, which help cells to sense their mechano-environment and transduce the signal accordingly. Although both proteins function in tandem, most literature focuses on them individually. Here, we provide a focused review of the talin-integrin mechano-interactome network in light of its role in the process of mechanotransduction and its connection to diseases. While working under force, these proteins drive numerous biomolecular interactions and form adhesion complexes, which in turn control many physiological processes such as cell migration; thus, they are invariably associated with several diseases from leukocyte adhesion deficiency to cancer. Gaining insights into their role in the occurrence of these pathological disorders might lead us to establish treatment methods and therapeutic techniques.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

The head domain binds integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, which triggers integrin conformational activation to increase affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. The rod domain links to actin filaments inside the cell to transmit mechanical loads and serves as a mechanosensitive signalling hub for the recruitment of many other proteins. The α-helical bundles function as force-dependent switches - proteins that interact with folded bundles are displaced when force induces unfolding, exposing previously cryptic binding sites for other ligands. This leads to the notion of a talin code. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we propose that the multiple switches within the talin rod function to process and store time- and force-dependent mechanical and chemical information.",

            "abstract": "Leukocyte integrins of the beta2 family are essential for immune cell-cell adhesion. In activated cells, beta2 integrins are phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic Thr758, leading to 14-3-3 protein recruitment to the beta2 integrin. The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E. (1992) Cell 71, 891-894; Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.",

There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.",

            "abstract": "Transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, mediate cell adhesion by interacting with intracellular proteins that connect to the cytoskeleton. Talin, one such linker protein, is thought to have two roles: mediating inside-out activation of integrins, and connecting extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin's amino-terminal head, which consists of a FERM domain, binds an NPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of most integrin beta subunits. This is consistent with the role of FERM domains in recruiting other proteins to the plasma membrane. We tested the role of the talin-head-NPxY interaction in integrin function in Drosophila. We found that introduction of a mutation that perturbs this binding in vitro into the isolated talin head disrupts its recruitment by integrins in vivo. Surprisingly, when engineered into the full-length talin, this mutation did not disrupt talin recruitment by integrins nor its ability to connect integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, it reduced the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM, indicating that the function of the talin-head-NPxY interaction is solely to regulate integrin adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP450, but dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.",

            "abstract": "The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication. ",

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent adhesion sites consist of clustered integrins that transmit mechanical forces and provide signaling required for cell survival and morphogenesis. Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.",

            "abstract": "Talin1 is a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to actin filaments through two distinct integrin binding sites, one present in the talin head domain (IBS1) necessary for integrin activation and a second (IBS2) that we have previously mapped to talin residues 1984-2113 (fragment J) of the talin rod domain (1 Tremuth, L., Kreis, S., Melchior, C., Hoebeke, J., Ronde, P., Plancon, S., Takeda, K., and Kieffer, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in alpha helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this alpha helix, which disrupted the alpha-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an alphaIIbbeta3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1(-/-) cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric αβ integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain comprised of F1, F2 and F3 domains, but it is atypical in that F1 contains a large insert and is preceded by an extra domain F0. Although F3 contains the binding site for beta-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of beta1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of beta1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large (∼2540 residues) dimeric adaptor protein that associates with the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules in cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), where it both activates integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. Calpain2-mediated cleavage of talin between the head and rod domains has previously been shown to be important in FA turnover. Here we identify an additional calpain2-cleavage site that removes the dimerisation domain from the C-terminus of the talin rod, and show that an E2492G mutation inhibits calpain cleavage at this site in vitro, and increases the steady state levels of talin1 in vivo. Expression of a GFP-tagged talin1 E2492G mutant in CHO.K1 cells inhibited FA turnover and the persistence of cell protrusion just as effectively as a L432G mutation that inhibits calpain cleavage between the talin head and rod domains. Moreover, incorporation of both mutations into a single talin molecule had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that calpain cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin contribute to the regulation of FA dynamics. However, the N-terminal site was more sensitive to calpain cleavage suggesting that lower levels of calpain are required to liberate the talin head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the C-terminal dimerisation domain. The talin head and rod liberated by calpain2 cleavage have recently been shown to play roles in an integrin activation cycle important in FA turnover and in FAK-dependent cell cycle progression respectively. The half-life of the talin head is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and we suggest that removal of the C-terminal dimerisation domain from the talin rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the signalling function of the talin rod and indeed for inactivating full-length talin thereby promoting FA turnover at the rear of the cell.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a ubiquitous, large focal adhesion protein that links intracellular networks with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via its connection with the actin cytoskeleton and membrane integrins. It is one of a handful molecules that can expose new recognition sites when undergoing force-induced mechanical unfolding, and it can bind and recruit cytoskeletal proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction. Talin has attracted great interest in the field of mechanobiology because of its plasticity in undergoing conformational changes under force stimulation as well as its cellular localization that bridges the cytoskeleton with the ECM. In addition to these roles in healthy cells, the dysregulation of talin activators can lead to disease states in which aberrant integrin activation and mechanotransduction precipitate changes in cell spreading, migration, and survival. New data have implicated a role for talin in diseases that are highly regulated by mechanical cues. In this review, we present the current understanding of talin structure, its relationship to binding partners, and its role in disease states.-Haining, A. W. M., Lieberthal, T. J., del Río Hernández, A. Talin: a mechanosensitive molecule in health and disease.",

            "abstract": "Previous experiments with peptide fusion proteins suggested that cyclin A/Cdk1 and Cdk2 might exhibit similar yet distinct phosphorylation specificities. Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/Cux(Cdc6) mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, is exquisitely sensitive to biochemical, structural, and mechanical features of the ECM. Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Three vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) have previously been identified in the talin rod using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To extend these studies, we spot-synthesized a series of peptides spanning all the alpha-helical regions predicted for the talin rod and identified eight additional VBSs, two of which overlap key functional regions of the rod, including the integrin binding site and C-terminal actin binding site. The talin VBS alpha-helices bind to a hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminal vinculin Vd1 domain. We have defined the specificity of this interaction by spot-synthesizing a series of 25-mer talin VBS1 peptides containing substitutions with all the commonly occurring amino acids. The consensus for recognition is LXXAAXXVAXX- VXXLIXXA with distinct classes of hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16 required for vinculin binding. Positions 1, 8, 12, 15, and 16 require an aliphatic residue and will not tolerate alanine, whereas positions 4, 5, and 9 are less restrictive. These preferences are common to all 11 VBS sequences with a minor variation occurring in one case. A crystal structure of this variant VBS peptide in complex with the vinculin Vd1 domain reveals a subtly different mode of vinculin binding.",

            "abstract": "Talins are cytoskeletal linker proteins that consist of an N-terminal head domain, a flexible neck region and a C-terminal rod domain made of 13 helical bundles. The head domain binds integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails, which triggers integrin conformational activation to increase affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. The rod domain links to actin filaments inside the cell to transmit mechanical loads and serves as a mechanosensitive signalling hub for the recruitment of many other proteins. The α-helical bundles function as force-dependent switches - proteins that interact with folded bundles are displaced when force induces unfolding, exposing previously cryptic binding sites for other ligands. This leads to the notion of a talin code. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we propose that the multiple switches within the talin rod function to process and store time- and force-dependent mechanical and chemical information.",

            "abstract": "Following platelet aggregation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) becomes associated with the platelet cytoskeleton. The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

KANKs interact with the integrin/actin-binding protein talin and with several components of microtubule-stabilizing cortical complexes. Because of actomyosin contractility, the talin-KANK complex is likely under mechanical force, and its mechanical stability is expected to be a critical determinant of KANK recruitment to focal adhesions. Here, we quantified the lifetime of the complex of the talin rod domain R7 and the KN domain of KANK1 under shear-force geometry and found that it can withstand forces for seconds to minutes over a physiological force range up to 10 pN. Complex stability measurements combined with cell biological experiments suggest that shear-force stretching promotes KANK1 localization to the periphery of focal adhesions. These results indicate that the talin-KANK1 complex is mechanically strong, enabling it to support the cross-talk between microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which provides a direct link between integrins and actin filaments, has been shown to contain two distinct binding sites for integrin beta subunits. Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3), linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984-2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with beta(3)-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant beta(3) cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between beta(3)-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984-2113) that also localized to focal adhesions. Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for beta(3)-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation.",

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.",

The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "In most tissues, anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices (ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain comprised of F1, F2 and F3 domains, but it is atypical in that F1 contains a large insert and is preceded by an extra domain F0. Although F3 contains the binding site for beta-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of beta1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of beta1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E. (1992) Cell 71, 891-894; Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.",

            "abstract": "The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication. ",

            "abstract": "Transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, mediate cell adhesion by interacting with intracellular proteins that connect to the cytoskeleton. Talin, one such linker protein, is thought to have two roles: mediating inside-out activation of integrins, and connecting extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin's amino-terminal head, which consists of a FERM domain, binds an NPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of most integrin beta subunits. This is consistent with the role of FERM domains in recruiting other proteins to the plasma membrane. We tested the role of the talin-head-NPxY interaction in integrin function in Drosophila. We found that introduction of a mutation that perturbs this binding in vitro into the isolated talin head disrupts its recruitment by integrins in vivo. Surprisingly, when engineered into the full-length talin, this mutation did not disrupt talin recruitment by integrins nor its ability to connect integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, it reduced the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM, indicating that the function of the talin-head-NPxY interaction is solely to regulate integrin adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP450, but dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a ubiquitous, large focal adhesion protein that links intracellular networks with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via its connection with the actin cytoskeleton and membrane integrins. It is one of a handful molecules that can expose new recognition sites when undergoing force-induced mechanical unfolding, and it can bind and recruit cytoskeletal proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction. Talin has attracted great interest in the field of mechanobiology because of its plasticity in undergoing conformational changes under force stimulation as well as its cellular localization that bridges the cytoskeleton with the ECM. In addition to these roles in healthy cells, the dysregulation of talin activators can lead to disease states in which aberrant integrin activation and mechanotransduction precipitate changes in cell spreading, migration, and survival. New data have implicated a role for talin in diseases that are highly regulated by mechanical cues. In this review, we present the current understanding of talin structure, its relationship to binding partners, and its role in disease states.-Haining, A. W. M., Lieberthal, T.

            "abstract": "Mechanotransduction from the extracellular matrix into the cell is primarily supervised by a transmembrane receptor, integrin, and a cytosolic protein, talin. Integrin binds ligands on the extracellular side, whereas talin couples integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and later acts as a \"force buffer\". Talin and integrin together form a mechanosensitive signaling hub that regulates crucial cellular processes and pathways, including cell signaling and formation of focal adhesion complexes, which help cells to sense their mechano-environment and transduce the signal accordingly. Although both proteins function in tandem, most literature focuses on them individually. Here, we provide a focused review of the talin-integrin mechano-interactome network in light of its role in the process of mechanotransduction and its connection to diseases. While working under force, these proteins drive numerous biomolecular interactions and form adhesion complexes, which in turn control many physiological processes such as cell migration; thus, they are invariably associated with several diseases from leukocyte adhesion deficiency to cancer. Gaining insights into their role in the occurrence of these pathological disorders might lead us to establish treatment methods and therapeutic techniques.",

            "abstract": "Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric αβ integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.",

Despite this, the mechanism by which protein unfolding elicits differential downstream signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein engineering, atomic force microscopy, and biophysical tools to delineate how protein unfolding controls cell mechanics. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a negative regulator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell contractility that regulates cell behaviour when localised to focal adhesions bound to folded talin. Using a talin mutant resistant to force-induced unfolding of R8 domain, we show that talin unfolding determines DLC1 downstream signalling and, consequently, cell mechanics. We propose that this new mechanism of mechanotransduction may have implications for a wide variety of associated cellular processes.",

            "abstract": "Leukocyte integrins of the beta2 family are essential for immune cell-cell adhesion. In activated cells, beta2 integrins are phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic Thr758, leading to 14-3-3 protein recruitment to the beta2 integrin. The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, is exquisitely sensitive to biochemical, structural, and mechanical features of the ECM. Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are protein machineries essential for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

(2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in alpha helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this alpha helix, which disrupted the alpha-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an alphaIIbbeta3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1(-/-) cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin plays a key role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Three vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) have previously been identified in the talin rod using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To extend these studies, we spot-synthesized a series of peptides spanning all the alpha-helical regions predicted for the talin rod and identified eight additional VBSs, two of which overlap key functional regions of the rod, including the integrin binding site and C-terminal actin binding site. The talin VBS alpha-helices bind to a hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminal vinculin Vd1 domain. We have defined the specificity of this interaction by spot-synthesizing a series of 25-mer talin VBS1 peptides containing substitutions with all the commonly occurring amino acids. The consensus for recognition is LXXAAXXVAXX- VXXLIXXA with distinct classes of hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16 required for vinculin binding. Positions 1, 8, 12, 15, and 16 require an aliphatic residue and will not tolerate alanine, whereas positions 4, 5, and 9 are less restrictive. These preferences are common to all 11 VBS sequences with a minor variation occurring in one case. A crystal structure of this variant VBS peptide in complex with the vinculin Vd1 domain reveals a subtly different mode of vinculin binding.",

By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.",

            "abstract": "Previous experiments with peptide fusion proteins suggested that cyclin A/Cdk1 and Cdk2 might exhibit similar yet distinct phosphorylation specificities. Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/Cux(Cdc6) mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase.",

            "abstract": "Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large (∼2540 residues) dimeric adaptor protein that associates with the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules in cell-extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), where it both activates integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. Calpain2-mediated cleavage of talin between the head and rod domains has previously been shown to be important in FA turnover. Here we identify an additional calpain2-cleavage site that removes the dimerisation domain from the C-terminus of the talin rod, and show that an E2492G mutation inhibits calpain cleavage at this site in vitro, and increases the steady state levels of talin1 in vivo. Expression of a GFP-tagged talin1 E2492G mutant in CHO.K1 cells inhibited FA turnover and the persistence of cell protrusion just as effectively as a L432G mutation that inhibits calpain cleavage between the talin head and rod domains. Moreover, incorporation of both mutations into a single talin molecule had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that calpain cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin contribute to the regulation of FA dynamics. However, the N-terminal site was more sensitive to calpain cleavage suggesting that lower levels of calpain are required to liberate the talin head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the C-terminal dimerisation domain. The talin head and rod liberated by calpain2 cleavage have recently been shown to play roles in an integrin activation cycle important in FA turnover and in FAK-dependent cell cycle progression respectively. The half-life of the talin head is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and we suggest that removal of the C-terminal dimerisation domain from the talin rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the signalling function of the talin rod and indeed for inactivating full-length talin thereby promoting FA turnover at the rear of the cell.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a key protein involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. The long flexible talin rod domain contains a number of binding sites for vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein important in stabilizing integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Here we report the solution structure of a talin rod polypeptide (residues 1843-1973) which contains a single vinculin binding site (VBS; residues 1944-1969). Like other talin rod polypeptides, it consists of a helical bundle, in this case a four-helix bundle with a right-handed topology. The residues in the VBS important for vinculin binding were identified by studying the binding of a series of VBS-related peptides to the vinculin Vd1 domain. The key binding determinants are buried in the interior of the helical bundle, suggesting that a substantial structural change in the talin polypeptide is required for vinculin binding. Direct evidence for this was obtained by NMR and EPR spectroscopy. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of the talin fragment indicate that vinculin binding caused approximately two-thirds of the protein to adopt a flexible random coil. For EPR spectroscopy, nitroxide spin labels were attached to the talin polypeptide via appropriately located cysteine residues. Measurements of inter-nitroxide distances in doubly spin-labeled protein showed clearly that the helical bundle is disrupted and the mobility of the helices, except for the VBS helix, is markedly increased. Binding of vinculin to talin is thus a clear example of the unusual phenomenon of protein unfolding being required for protein/protein interaction.",

We have determined the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod spanning residues 482-789. Talin 482-655, which contains a vinculin-binding site (VBS), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin 656-789 is a four-helix bundle. We show that the VBS is composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix 4. All the key side chains from the VBS are buried and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the talin 482-655 fold. We demonstrate that the talin 482-655 five-helix bundle represents an inactive conformation, and mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core or deletion of helix 5 are required to induce an active conformation in which the VBS is exposed. We also report the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. Activation of the VBS in talin and the recruitment of vinculin may support the maturation of small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.",

There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.",
