            "Abstract": "Talin is a mechanosensitive adapter protein that couples integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talin rod domain-containing protein 1 (TLNRD1) shares 22% homology with the talin R7R8 rod domains, and is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, although little is known about its function. Here we show that TLNRD1 is an α-helical protein structurally homologous to talin R7R8. Like talin R7R8, TLNRD1 binds F-actin, but because it forms a novel antiparallel dimer, it also bundles F-actin. In addition, it binds the same LD motif-containing proteins, RIAM and KANK, as talin R7R8. In cells, TLNRD1 localizes to actin bundles as well as to filopodia. Increasing TLNRD1 expression enhances filopodia formation and cell migration on 2D substrates, while TLNRD1 down-regulation has the opposite effect. Together, our results suggest that TLNRD1 has retained the diverse interactions of talin R7R8, but has developed distinct functionality as an actin-bundling protein that promotes filopodia assembly.",

            "abstract": "Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.",

            "abstract": "Talin-1 is a key component of the multiprotein adhesion complexes which mediate cell migration, adhesion and integrin signalling and has been linked to cancer in several studies. We analysed talin-1 mutations reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database and developed a bioinformatics pipeline to predict the severity of each mutation. These predictions were then assessed using biochemistry and cell biology experiments. With this approach we were able to identify several talin-1 mutations affecting integrin activity, actin recruitment and Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 localization. We explored potential changes in talin-1 signalling responses by assessing impact on migration, invasion and proliferation. Altogether, this study describes a pipeline approach of experiments for crude characterization of talin-1 mutants in order to evaluate their functional effects and potential pathogenicity. Our findings suggest that cancer related point mutations in talin-1 can affect cell behaviour and so may contribute to cancer progression.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are protein machineries essential for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.",

On the other hand, data summaries are often used in graphs because they aid interpretation. To democratize state-of-the-art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries, a freely available, open-source web app was written using R/shiny that uses the ggplot2 package for generating plots. Users can to choose how to display the data and which of the data summaries to add. In addition, the 95% confidence intervals (95CIs) can be added for visual inferences. By adjusting the visibility of the layers, the visualization of the raw data and their summaries can be tuned for optimal presentation and interpretation.

            "abstract": "Filopodia are adhesive cellular protrusions specialized in the detection of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived cues. Although ECM engagement at focal adhesions is known to trigger the recruitment of hundreds of proteins (\"adhesome\") to fine-tune cellular behavior, the components of the filopodia adhesions remain undefined. Here, we performed a structured-illumination-microscopy-based screen to map the localization of 80 target proteins, linked to cell adhesion and migration, within myosin-X-induced filopodia. We demonstrate preferential enrichment of several adhesion proteins to either filopodia tips, filopodia shafts, or shaft subdomains, suggesting divergent, spatially restricted functions for these proteins. Moreover, proteins with phosphoinositide (PI) binding sites are particularly enriched in filopodia. This, together with the strong localization of PI(3,4)P2 in filopodia tips, predicts critical roles for PIs in regulating filopodia ultra-structure and function. Our mapping further reveals that filopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins, the filopodome, that are distinct from classical nascent adhesions, focal adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions. Using live imaging, we observe that filopodia adhesions can give rise to nascent adhesions, which, in turn, form focal adhesions. We demonstrate that p130Cas (BCAR1) is recruited to filopodia tips via its C-terminal Cas family homology domain (CCHD) and acts as a mechanosensitive regulator of filopodia stability. Finally, we demonstrate that our map based on myosin-X-induced filopodia can be translated to endogenous filopodia and fascin- and IRSp53-mediated filopodia.",

            "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, is exquisitely sensitive to biochemical, structural, and mechanical features of the ECM. Talin is a cytoplasmic protein consisting of a globular head domain and a series of α-helical bundles that form its long rod domain. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β-subunits, activates integrins, couples them to the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates integrin signaling. Recent evidence suggests switch-like behavior of the helix bundles that make up the talin rod domains, where individual domains open at different tension levels, exerting positive or negative effects on different protein interactions. These results lead us to propose that talin functions as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates multiple extracellular and intracellular inputs to define a major axis of adhesion signaling.",

We aimed to assemble a miRNA expression database from independent datasets to enable an independent validation of previously published prognostic biomarkers of HCC. A miRNA expression database was established by searching the TCGA (RNA-seq) and GEO (microarray) repositories to identify miRNA datasets with available expression and clinical data. A PubMed search was performed to identify prognostic miRNAs for HCC. We performed a uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis to validate the prognostic significance of these miRNAs. The Limma R package was applied to compare the expression of miRNAs between tumor and normal tissues. We uncovered 214 publications containing 223 miRNAs identified as potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC. In the survival analysis, the expression levels of 55 and 84 miRNAs were significantly correlated with overall survival in RNA-seq and gene chip datasets, respectively. The most significant miRNAs were hsa-miR-149, hsa-miR-139, and hsa-miR-3677 in the RNA-seq and hsa-miR-146b-3p, hsa-miR-584, and hsa-miR-31 in the microarray dataset. Of the 223 miRNAs studied, the expression was significantly altered in 102 miRNAs in tumors compared to normal liver tissues. In summary, we set up an integrated miRNA expression database and validated prognostic miRNAs in HCC.",

            "abstract": "Defective filopodia formation is linked to pathologies such as cancer, wherein actively protruding filopodia, at the invasive front, accompany cancer cell dissemination. Despite wide biological significance, delineating filopodia function in complex systems remains challenging and is particularly hindered by lack of compatible methods to quantify filopodia properties. Here, we present FiloQuant, a freely available ImageJ plugin, to detect filopodia-like protrusions in both fixed- and live-cell microscopy data. We demonstrate that FiloQuant can extract quantifiable information, including protrusion dynamics, density, and length, from multiple cell types and in a range of microenvironments. In cellular models of breast ductal carcinoma in situ, we reveal a link between filopodia formation at the cell-matrix interface, in collectively invading cells and 3D tumor spheroids, and the in vitro invasive capacity of the carcinoma. Finally, using intravital microscopy, we observe that tumor spheroids display filopodia in vivo, supporting a potential role for these protrusions during tumorigenesis.",

            "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer associated mortality. Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as critical factors for tumor recurrence and metastasis. MiR-508-5p has been reported as a down-regulated miRNA in the primary gastric cancer tissues. However, the role of miR-508-5p on HCC has not been well elucidated. In this study, we observed that miR-508-5p was downregulated in HCC tissues when compared to the non-tumorous tissues. We then demonstrated that overexpression of miR-508-5p attenuated HepG2 cells proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, our further investigations revealed that mesoderm development candidate 1 (MESDC1) is a potential target of miR-508-5p, as well as miR-508-5p overexpression downregulated MESDC1 expression. Overexpression of MESDC1 promoted HepG2 cells migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro. In addition, miR-508-5p markedly suppressed the tumor growth in xenograft model, while MESDC1 promoted the tumor growth in xenograft model. This study provides new insight into molecular mechanisms that miR-508-5p acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting MESDC1 in HCC progression.",

Currently the HGNC database contains almost 40 000 approved gene symbols, over 19 000 of which represent protein-coding genes. In addition to naming genomic loci we manually curate genes into family sets based on shared characteristics such as homology, function or phenotype. We have recently updated our gene family resources and introduced new improved visualizations which can be seen alongside our gene symbol reports on our primary website http://www.genenames.org In 2016 we expanded our remit and formed the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) which is responsible for assigning names to vertebrate species lacking a dedicated nomenclature group. Using the chimpanzee genome as a pilot project we have approved symbols and names for over 14 500 protein-coding genes in chimpanzee, and have developed a new website http://vertebrate.genenames.org to distribute these data. Here, we review our online data and resources, focusing particularly on the improvements and new developments made during the last two years.",

Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity.",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5β and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.",

Talin plays a key role in coupling integrin receptors to the actomyosin contractile machinery, while deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a Rho GAP that binds talin and regulates Rho, and therefore actomyosin contractility. We show that the LD motif of DLC1 forms a helix that binds to the four-helix bundle of the talin R8 domain in a canonical triple-helix arrangement. We demonstrate that the same R8 surface interacts with the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs. We identify key charged residues that stabilize the R8 interactions with LD motifs and demonstrate their importance in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest a network of competitive interactions in adhesion complexes that involve LD motifs, and identify mutations that can be used to analyze the biological roles of specific protein-protein interactions in cell migration.",

            "abstract": "The degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid in a protein or a nucleic acid in DNA/RNA reflects a balance between its natural tendency to mutate and the overall need to retain the structural integrity and function of the macromolecule. The ConSurf web server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il), established over 15 years ago, analyses the evolutionary pattern of the amino/nucleic acids of the macromolecule to reveal regions that are important for structure and/or function. Starting from a query sequence or structure, the server automatically collects homologues, infers their multiple sequence alignment and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree that reflects their evolutionary relations. These data are then used, within a probabilistic framework, to estimate the evolutionary rates of each sequence position. Here we introduce several new features into ConSurf, including automatic selection of the best evolutionary model used to infer the rates, the ability to homology-model query proteins, prediction of the secondary structure of query RNA molecules from sequence, the ability to view the biological assembly of a query (in addition to the single chain), mapping of the conservation grades onto 2D RNA models and an advanced view of the phylogenetic tree that enables interactively rerunning ConSurf with the taxa of a sub-tree.",

            "abstract": "Integrin-dependent adhesions are mechanosensitive structures in which talin mediates a linkage to actin filaments either directly or indirectly by recruiting vinculin. Here, we report the development and validation of a talin tension sensor. We find that talin in focal adhesions is under tension, which is higher in peripheral than central adhesions. Tension on talin is increased by vinculin and depends mainly on actin-binding site 2 (ABS2) within the middle of the rod domain, rather than ABS3 at the far C terminus. Unlike vinculin, talin is under lower tension on soft substrates. The difference between central and peripheral adhesions requires ABS3 but not vinculin or ABS2. However, differential stiffness sensing by talin requires ABS2 but not vinculin or ABS3. These results indicate that central versus peripheral adhesions must be organized and regulated differently, and that ABS2 and ABS3 have distinct functions in spatial variations and stiffness sensing. Overall, these results shed new light on talin function and constrain models for cellular mechanosensing.",

            "abstract": "The link between extracellular-matrix-bound integrins and intracellular F-actin is essential for cell spreading and migration. Here, we demonstrate how the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link. By expressing structure-based talin mutants in talin null cells, we show that while the C-terminal actin-binding site (ABS3) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly, the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion (FA) maturation. Thus, although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading, the cells lack FAs, fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix. ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin-binding R3 domain, and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force-independent FAs, although cell polarity is compromised. Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin-talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding, activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin-binding configuration that stabilizes FAs.

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

In particular, we focus on recent advances demonstrating that filopodia are involved in substrate tethering and environment sensing in vivo. We further discuss the emerging role of filopodia and filopodial proteins in tumor dissemination as mounting in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence suggest that filopodia drive cancer cell invasion and highlight filopodia proteins as attractive therapeutic targets. Finally, we outline outstanding questions that remain to be addressed to elucidate the role of filopodia during 3D cell migration. ",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

LD motifs are required for embryogenesis, wound healing and the evolution of multicellularity. LD motifs also play roles in disease, such as in cancer metastasis or viral infection. First described in the paxillin family of scaffolding proteins, LD motifs and similar acidic LXXLL interaction motifs have been discovered in several other proteins, whereas 16 proteins have been reported to contain LDBDs (LD motif-binding domains). Collectively, structural and functional analyses have revealed a surprising multivalency in LD motif interactions and a wide diversity in LDBD architectures. In the present review, we summarize the molecular basis for function, regulation and selectivity of LD motif interactions that has emerged from more than a decade of research. This overview highlights the intricate multi-level regulation and the inherently noisy and heterogeneous nature of signalling through short protein-protein interaction motifs.",

Talins and kindlins, two families of FERM-domain proteins, bind the cytoplasmic tail of integrins, recruit cytoskeletal and signalling proteins involved in mechanotransduction and synergize to activate integrin binding to extracellular ligands. New data reveal the domain structure of full-length talin, provide insights into talin-mediated integrin activation and show that RIAM recruits talin to the plasma membrane, whereas vinculin stabilizes talin in cell-matrix junctions. How kindlins act is less well-defined, but disease-causing mutations show that kindlins are also essential for integrin activation, adhesion, cell spreading and signalling. ",

            "abstract": "Following integration of the observed diffraction spots, the process of `data reduction' initially aims to determine the point-group symmetry of the data and the likely space group. This can be performed with the program POINTLESS. The scaling program then puts all the measurements on a common scale, averages measurements of symmetry-related reflections (using the symmetry determined previously) and produces many statistics that provide the first important measures of data quality. A new scaling program, AIMLESS, implements scaling models similar to those in SCALA but adds some additional analyses. From the analyses, a number of decisions can be made about the quality of the data and whether some measurements should be discarded. The effective `resolution' of a data set is a difficult and possibly contentious question (particularly with referees of papers) and this is discussed in the light of tests comparing the data-processing statistics with trials of refinement against observed and simulated data, and automated model-building and comparison of maps calculated with different resolution limits. These trials show that adding weak high-resolution data beyond the commonly used limits may make some improvement and does no harm. ",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein interactions in free solution and with low sample consumption. The technique is based on thermophoresis, the directed motion of molecules in temperature gradients. Thermophoresis is highly sensitive to all types of binding-induced changes of molecular properties, be it in size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. In an all-optical approach, an infrared laser is used for local heating, and molecule mobility in the temperature gradient is analyzed via fluorescence. In standard MST one binding partner is fluorescently labeled. However, MST can also be performed label-free by exploiting intrinsic protein UV-fluorescence. Despite the high molecular weight ratio, the interaction of small molecules and peptides with proteins is readily accessible by MST. Furthermore, MST assays are highly adaptable to fit to the diverse requirements of different biomolecules, such as membrane proteins to be stabilized in solution. The type of buffer and additives can be chosen freely. Measuring is even possible in complex bioliquids like cell lysate allowing close to in vivo conditions without sample purification. Binding modes that are quantifiable via MST include dimerization, cooperativity and competition. Thus, its flexibility in assay design qualifies MST for analysis of biomolecular interactions in complex experimental settings, which we herein demonstrate by addressing typically challenging types of binding events from various fields of life science.",

            "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinase activity is known to occur in the absence of extracellular stimuli. Importantly, this \"background\" level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response, suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation, but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation, FGFR2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on Grb2, promoting dissociation from the receptor and allowing full activation of downstream signaling. These observations establish a role for Grb2 as an active regulator of RTK signaling.",

It has several automation features and is also highly flexible. Several hundred parameters enable extensive customizations for complex use cases. Multiple user-defined refinement strategies can be applied to specific parts of the model in a single refinement run. An intuitive graphical user interface is available to guide novice users and to assist advanced users in managing refinement projects. X-ray or neutron diffraction data can be used separately or jointly in refinement. phenix.refine is tightly integrated into the PHENIX suite, where it serves as a critical component in automated model building, final structure refinement, structure validation and deposition to the wwPDB. This paper presents an overview of the major phenix.refine features, with extensive literature references for readers interested in more detailed discussions of the methods.",

            "abstract": "Our previous studies suggested that microRNA (miR)-574-3p is a candidate             tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) in human bladder cancer (BC). Among 17 down-regulated             miRNAs, miR-574-3p is located on chromosome 4p14 where we had identified a chromosomal             loss region by array-CGH in BC cell lines. MiR-574-3p expression was down-regulated             in BC cell lines. Gain-of-function analysis revealed that cell proliferation,             migration and invasion were significantly inhibited in miR‑574‑3p-transfected             BC cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that cell apoptosis was induced             in miR-574-3p transfectants. Oligo microarray analysis suggested that the mesoderm             development candidate 1 (MESDC1) gene was a target gene in miR-574-3p transfectants.             Luciferase assays revealed that miR‑574‑3p was directly bound to MESDC1 mRNA.             MESDC1 is predicted to be a novel actin-binding protein located on chromosome             15q13. Although the gene is conserved among many species, its functional role             is still unknown in both human malignancies and normal tissues. Loss-of-function             studies demonstrated that cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly             inhibited in si-MESDC1-transfected BC cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed             that apoptosis was induced in si-MESDC1 transfectants. We are the first to demonstrate             that miR-574-3p is a miRNA with tumor suppressor function and that MESDC1 (which             has a potential oncogenic function in BC) may be targeted by miR-574-3p.",

Here, we report that DLC1 forms a complex with two prooncogenic focal adhesion proteins, talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified an 8-aa sequence (residues 469LDDILYHV476) in DLC1 and designated it an LD-like motif, because it shares homology with the LD motifs of paxillin. This motif was necessary for DLC1 binding to talin and FAK, because a DLC1 mutant, from which six of the residues have been deleted, and another mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in three of the residues are deficient for binding both proteins and localization of DLC1 to focal adhesions. FAK binding was independent of talin and vice versa. In bioassays, both DLC1 mutants were less active than wild-type (WT) DLC1, although the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate overall Rho-GTP was not impaired. We conclude that the LD-like motif, which binds talin and FAK, is required for the full tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 and contributes to the association of DLC1 with focal adhesions.",

This creates a challenge for the high-throughput operation of modern synchrotron beamlines as well as for the subsequent data processing. Novice users in particular may feel overwhelmed by the tables, plots and numbers that the different data-processing programs and software packages present to them. Here, some of the more common problems that a user has to deal with when processing a set of images that will finally make up a processed data set are shown, concentrating on difficulties that may often show up during the first steps along the path of turning the experiment (i.e. data collection) into a model (i.e. interpreted electron density). Difficulties such as unexpected crystal forms, issues in crystal handling and suboptimal choices of data-collection strategies can often be dealt with, or at least diagnosed, by analysing specific data characteristics during processing. In the end, one wants to distinguish problems over which one has no immediate control once the experiment is finished from problems that can be remedied a posteriori. A new software package, autoPROC, is also presented that combines third-party processing programs with new tools and an automated workflow script that is intended to provide users with both guidance and insight into the offline processing of data affected by the difficulties mentioned above, with particular emphasis on the automated treatment of multi-sweep data sets collected on multi-axis goniostats.",

It covers determination of the point-group symmetry of the diffraction data (the Laue group), which is required for the subsequent scaling step, examination of systematic absences, which in many cases will allow inference of the space group, putting multiple data sets on a common indexing system when there are alternatives, the scaling step itself, which produces a large set of data-quality indicators, estimation of |F| from intensity and finally examination of intensity statistics to detect crystal pathologies such as twinning. An appendix outlines the scoring schemes used by the program POINTLESS to assign probabilities to possible Laue and space groups.",

            "abstract": "FERM domains are found in a diverse superfamily of signaling and adaptor proteins at membrane interfaces. They typically consist of three separately folded domains (F1, F2, F3) in a compact cloverleaf structure. The crystal structure of the N-terminal head of the integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein talin reported here reveals a novel FERM domain with a linear domain arrangement, plus an additional domain F0 packed against F1. While F3 binds β-integrin tails, basic residues in F1 and F2 are required for membrane association and for integrin activation. We show that these same residues are also required for cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly in cells. We suggest that the extended conformation of the talin head allows simultaneous binding to integrins via F3 and to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched microdomains via basic residues distributed along one surface of the talin head, and that these multiple interactions are required to stabilize integrins in the activated state.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.",

            "abstract": "MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.",

The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.",

            "abstract": "The type VI intermediate filament (IF) protein synemin is a unique member of the IF protein superfamily. Synemin associates with the major type III IF protein desmin forming heteropolymeric intermediate filaments (IFs) within developed mammalian striated muscle cells. These IFs encircle and link all adjacent myofibrils together at their Z-lines, as well as link the Z-lines of the peripheral layer of cellular myofibrils to the costameres located periodically along and subjacent to the sarcolemma. Costameres are multi-protein assemblies enriched in the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin, alpha-actinin, and talin. We report herein a direct interaction of human alpha-synemin with the cytoskeletal protein talin by protein-protein interaction assays. The 312 amino acid insert (SNTIII) present only within alpha-synemin binds to the rod domain of talin in vitro and co-localizes with talin at focal adhesion sites within mammalian muscle cells. Confocal microscopy studies showed that synemin co-localizes with talin within the costameres of human skeletal muscle cells. Analysis of the primary sequences of human alpha- and beta-synemins revealed that SNTIII is composed of seven tandem repeats, each containing a specific Ser/Thr-X-Arg-His/Gln (S/T-X-R-H/Q) motif. Our results suggest human alpha-synemin plays an essential role in linking the heteropolymeric IFs to adherens-type junctions, such as the costameres within mammalian striated muscle cells, via its interaction with talin, thereby helping provide mechanical integration for the muscle cell cytoskeleton.",

Using this information in macromolecular crystallography (MX) should in principle increase the efficiency of MX structure solution. This paper describes a molecular-replacement pipeline, BALBES, that makes extensive use of this repository. It uses a reorganized database taken from the PDB with multimeric as well as domain organization. A system manager written in Python controls the workflow of the process. Testing the current version of the pipeline using entries from the PDB has shown that this approach has huge potential and that around 75% of structures can be solved automatically without user intervention.",

Two mechanisms for the formation of filopodia have been suggested, each using different sets of actin-regulating proteins, creating some controversy in the field. New molecules, some of unknown functions, have also been implicated in filopodium formation, suggesting that other possible mechanisms of filopodium formation exist. We discuss established and novel proteins that mediate the formation and dynamics of filopodia, different mechanisms of filopodium formation, and the various functions that distinct filopodia perform.",

We also consider available theoretical approaches to the calculation of macromolecular affinity and entropy of complexation. The latter is shown to play an important role and make a major effect on complex size and symmetry. We develop a new method, based on chemical thermodynamics, for automatic detection of macromolecular assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries that are the results of X-ray diffraction experiments. As found, biological units may be recovered at 80-90% success rate, which makes X-ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on macromolecular complexes and protein-protein interactions. The method is implemented as a public WWW service.",

One approach toward understanding these interactions is to study mutations that disrupt development. Here, we demonstrate that mesd, a gene identified in the mesoderm development (mesd) deletion interval on mouse chromosome 7, is essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm induction. MESD functions in the endoplasmic reticulum as a specific chaperone for LRP5 and LRP6, which in conjunction with Frizzled, are coreceptors for canonical WNT signal transduction. Disruption of embryonic polarity and mesoderm differentiation in mesd-deficient embryos likely results from a primary defect in WNT signaling. However, phenotypic differences between mesd-deficient and wnt3(-)(/)(-) embryos suggest that MESD may function on related members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, whose members mediate diverse cellular processes ranging from cargo transport to signaling.",

            "abstract": "The proximal albino deletions identify several functional regions on mouse Chromosome 7 critical for differentiation of mesoderm (mesd), development of the hypothalamus neuroendocrine lineage (nelg), and function of the liver (hsdr1). Using comparative mapping and genomic sequence analysis, we have identified four novel genes and Il16 in the mesd deletion interval. Two of the novel genes, mesdc1 and mesdc2, are located within the mesd critical region defined by BAC transgenic rescue. We have investigated the fetal role of genes located outside the mesd critical region using BAC transgenic complementation of the mesd early embryonic lethality. Using human radiation hybrid mapping and BAC contig construction, we have identified a conserved region of human chromosome 15 homologous to the mesd, nelg, and hsdr1 functional regions. Three human diseases cosegregate with microsatellite markers used in construction of the human BAC/YAC physical map, including autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ENFL2; also known as ADNFLE), a syndrome of mental retardation, spasticity, and tapetoretinal degeneration (MRST); and a pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA).",

            "abstract": "We have determined the sequence of chicken talin (2,541 amino acids, M(r) 271,881) which is very similar (89% identity) to that of the mouse protein. Alignments with the Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum talin sequences show that the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein are conserved whereas the central part of the molecule is more divergent. By expressing overlapping talin polypeptides as fusion proteins, we have identified at least three regions of the protein which can bind F-actin: residues 102-497, 951-1,327 and 2,269-2,541. The N-terminal binding site contains a region with homology to the ERM family of actin-binding proteins, and the C-terminal site is homologous to the yeast actin-binding protein Sla2p. Each of the actin-binding sites is close to, but distinct from a binding site for vinculin, a protein which also binds actin. The Pro1176 to Thr substitution found in talin from Wistar-Furth rats does not destroy the capacity of this region of the protein to bind actin or vinculin. Microinjection studies showed that a fusion protein containing the N-terminal actin-binding site localised weakly to stress fibres, whereas one containing the C-terminal site initially localised predominantly to focal adhesions. The former was readily solubilised, and the latter was resistant to Triton extraction. The N-terminal talin polypeptide eventually disrupted actin stress fibres whereas the C-terminal polypeptide was without effect. However, a larger C-terminal fusion protein also containing a vinculin-binding site did disrupt stress fibres and focal adhesions. The results suggest that, although both the N- and C-terminal regions of talin bind actin, the properties of these two regions of the protein are distinct.",

Mouse embryos lacking msd (mesoderm deficiency) do not produce mesoderm but have well-defined extraembryonic and thickened embryonic ectoderm. Distribution of transcripts indicate that temporal regulation of gene expression relevant to gastrulation has begun but primitive-streak formation and mesoderm induction are blocked. Both msd-deficient embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to form highly differentiated structures of mesoderm origin, but are capable of ectodermal differentiation. Thus, the effects of the msd mutation are restricted to mesoderm formation and could result from the inability to respond to an inducing signal.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin are localized at cell-matrix junctions and are key regulators of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large dimeric protein that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles.

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "Cells reinforce adhesion strength and cytoskeleton anchoring in response to the actomyosin force. The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large adaptor protein that activates integrins and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "Filopodia are finger-like protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells that play a crucial antennal function during cell motility. It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin are localized at cell-matrix junctions and are key regulators of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP) belongs to the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) family of proteins involved in the regulation of actin-based functions including cell adhesion and motility. In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM)-bound GTPase Rap1 recruits the Rap1-interacting-adaptor-molecule (RIAM), which in turn recruits talin to bind and activate integrins. However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "Talin activates integrins, couples them to F-actin, and recruits vinculin to focal adhesions (FAs). Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "Cells reinforce adhesion strength and cytoskeleton anchoring in response to the actomyosin force. The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP) belongs to the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) family of proteins involved in the regulation of actin-based functions including cell adhesion and motility. In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "Talin activates integrins, couples them to F-actin, and recruits vinculin to focal adhesions (FAs). Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin are localized at cell-matrix junctions and are key regulators of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large dimeric protein that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "Filopodia are finger-like protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells that play a crucial antennal function during cell motility. It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization powers key cellular processes, including motility, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP) belongs to the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) family of proteins involved in the regulation of actin-based functions including cell adhesion and motility. In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in activating integrins and in coupling them to the actin cytoskeleton. Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Filopodia are finger-like protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells that play a crucial antennal function during cell motility. It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large dimeric protein that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin are localized at cell-matrix junctions and are key regulators of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "Talin activates integrins, couples them to F-actin, and recruits vinculin to focal adhesions (FAs). Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM)-bound GTPase Rap1 recruits the Rap1-interacting-adaptor-molecule (RIAM), which in turn recruits talin to bind and activate integrins. However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large adaptor protein that activates integrins and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization powers key cellular processes, including motility, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin are localized at cell-matrix junctions and are key regulators of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

            "abstract": "The membrane localization and activation of cytoskeletal protein talin are key steps to initiate the integrin transmembrane receptors' activation, which mediates many cellular adhesive responses such as cell migration, spreading and proliferation. RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP) belongs to the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) family of proteins involved in the regulation of actin-based functions including cell adhesion and motility. In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large adaptor protein that activates integrins and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

            "abstract": "Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP) belongs to the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) family of proteins involved in the regulation of actin-based functions including cell adhesion and motility. In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

Its rod region consists of a series of helical bundles. Here we show that residues 1815-1973 form a 5-helix bundle, with a topology unique to talin which is optimally suited for formation of a long rod such as talin. This is much more stable than the 4-helix (1843-1973) domain described earlier and as a result its vinculin binding sequence is inaccessible to vinculin at room temperature, with implications for the overall mechanism of the talin-vinculin interaction.",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization powers key cellular processes, including motility, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesion complexes are plasma membrane-associated multicomponent complexes that are essential for integrin-linked signal transduction as well as cell adhesion and cell motility. The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",

The actin turnover cycle depends critically on \"re-charging\" of ADP-actin monomers with ATP, but whether this reaction requires dedicated proteins in cells, and the underlying mechanism, have remained elusive. Here we report that nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ubiquitous cytoskeletal regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is critical for actin-based processes in vivo. We determine the structure of the CAP-actin complex, which reveals that nucleotide exchange occurs in a compact, sandwich-like complex formed between the dimeric actin-binding domain of CAP and two ADP-actin monomers. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of CAP associates with the nucleotide-sensing region of actin, and this interaction is required for rapid re-charging of actin by both yeast and mammalian CAPs. These data uncover the conserved structural basis and biological role of protein-catalyzed re-charging of actin monomers.",

            "abstract": "The folding of disulfide bond containing proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex process that requires protein folding factors, some of which are protein-specific. The ER resident saposin-like protein pERp1 (MZB1, CNPY5) is crucial for the correct folding of IgA, IgM and integrins. pERp1 also plays a role in ER calcium homeostasis and plasma cell mobility. As an important factor for proper IgM maturation and hence immune function, pERp1 is upregulated in many auto-immune diseases. This makes it a potential therapeutic target. pERp1 belongs to the CNPY family of ER resident saposin-like proteins. To date, five of these proteins have been identified. All are implicated in protein folding and all contain a saposin-like domain. All previously structurally characterized saposins are involved in lipid binding. However, there are no reports of CNPY family members interacting with lipids, suggesting a novel function for the saposin fold. However, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain elusive. To date, no structure of any CNPY protein has been reported. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.4 Å) crystal structure of human pERp1 and confirm that it has a saposin-fold with unique structural elements not present in other saposin-fold structures. The implications for the role of CNPY proteins in protein folding in the ER are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Integrins are fundamental to the control of protrusion and motility in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which specific members of this receptor family cooperate in signaling to cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of beta3 integrin in fibroblasts results in enhanced focal adhesion turnover and migration speed but impaired directional motility on both 2D and 3D matrices. These motility defects are coupled with an increased rate of actin-based protrusion. Analysis of downstream signaling events reveals that loss of beta3 integrin results in a loss of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Dephosphorylated VASP in beta3-null cells is preferentially associated with Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to enhanced formation of a VASP-RIAM complex at focal adhesions and subsequent increased binding of talin to beta1 integrin. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which alphavbeta3 integrin acts to locally suppress beta1 integrin activation and regulate protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and persistent migration.",

            "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) mechanically couple the extracellular matrix to the dynamic actin cytoskeleton, via transmembrane integrins and actin-binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9. Our results also demonstrate that, once this intramolecular interaction is released, the integrin-bound talin head retains the ability to inhibit actin assembly.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.",

RIAM, a membrane anchor and small GTPase RAP1 effector, is known to bind to the C-terminal rod domain of talin (talin-R) and promote localizations of talin to the membrane. Through systematic mapping analysis, we find that RIAM also binds to the N-terminal head of talin (talin-H), a crucial domain involved in binding and activating integrins. We show that the RIAM binding to talin-H sterically occludes the binding of a talin-R domain that otherwise masks the integrin-binding site on talin-H. We further provide functional evidence that such RIAM-mediated steric unmasking of talin triggers integrin activation. Our findings thus uncover a novel role for RIAM in conformational regulation of talin during integrin activation and cell adhesion. ",

            "abstract": "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.",

            "abstract": "Noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adapter protein that comprises one SH2 (Src homology) domain and three SH3 domains. Nck links receptors and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or adapter proteins to proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated receptors or associated phosphoproteins, individual interactions of the SH3 domains with proline-based recognition motifs result in the formation of larger protein complexes. In T cells, changes in cell polarity and morphology during T-cell activation and effector function require the T-cell receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of actin-regulatory proteins to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization at the immunological synapse. We previously identified the adapter protein HS1 as a putative Nck-interacting protein. We now demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Nck specifically interacts with HS1 upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue 378. We report that in human T cells, ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of tyrosine 378 of HS1 resulting in an increased association with Nck. Consequently, siRNA-mediated downregulation of HS1 and/or Nck impairs SDF1α-induced actin polymerization and T-cell migration. ",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeleton mediates various cellular processes such as differentiation and fusion, including in the filopodia and podosomes. However, apart from cell migration and formation of the sealing zone, little is known regarding the changes and related regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeleton and additional roles of the filopodia and podosomes during the differentiation and fusion of osteoclasts. The cytomorphology and cytoskeleton of osteoclasts in the differentiation process were evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, the expression levels of Rho GTPases and enzymes related to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We detected 3 types of filopodia in osteoclast precursors and only 1 type of filopodia in undifferentiated cells. Mature osteoclasts were completely devoid of filopodia. Interestingly, cell fusion was highly specific, and the fusion initially occurred to the filopodia. Confocal images revealed that F-actin and microtubules significantly differed among fused cells. These results suggest that filopodia and podosomes not only play important roles in cell migration and the formation of sealing zones but also in the pre-fusion selectivity of 2 cells and the movement direction of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm during the fusion process. In addition, cdc42v1, RhoU, and RhoF regulate the formation of 3 types of filopodia during various stages of differentiation, while Rac1, Rac2, and filament A may be associated with cell selectivity during the fusion process.

The role of the focal adhesion protein talin in regulating these structures is not known. Here, we demonstrate that talin is required for invadopodial matrix degradation and three-dimensional extracellular matrix invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. The sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and is known to regulate invadopodium-mediated matrix degradation. We show that the talin C terminus binds directly to the moesin band 4.1 ERM (FERM) domain to recruit a moesin-NHE-1 complex to invadopodia. Silencing talin resulted in a decrease in cytosolic pH at invadopodia and blocked cofilin-dependent actin polymerization, leading to impaired invadopodium stability and matrix degradation. Furthermore, talin is required for mammary tumor cell motility, intravasation, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a novel understanding of how intracellular pH is regulated and a molecular mechanism by which talin enhances tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large adaptor protein that activates integrins and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.

Talin couples integrins via its FERM domain to F-actin and is an important regulator of integrin activation and clustering. The 220 kDa talin rod domain comprises several four- and five-helix bundles that harbor amphipathic α-helical vinculin binding sites (VBSs). In its inactive state, the hydrophobic VBS residues involved in binding to vinculin are buried within these helix bundles, and the mechanical force emanating from bound integrin receptors is thought necessary for their release and binding to vinculin. The crystal structure of a four-helix bundle of talin that harbors one of these VBSs, coined VBS33, was recently determined. Here we report the crystal structure of VBS33 in complex with vinculin at 2 Å resolution. Notably, comparison of the apo and vinculin bound structures shows that intermolecular interactions of the VBS33 α-helix with vinculin are more extensive than the intramolecular interactions of the VBS33 within the talin four-helix bundle.",

            "abstract": "Cells reinforce adhesion strength and cytoskeleton anchoring in response to the actomyosin force. The mechanical stretching of talin, which exposes cryptic vinculin-binding sites, triggers this process. The binding of RIAM to talin could regulate this mechanism. However, the mechanosensitivity of the talin-RIAM complex has never been tested. It is also not known whether RIAM controls the mechanosensitivity of the talin-vinculin complex. To address these issues, we designed an in vitro microscopy assay with purified proteins in which the actomyosin force controls RIAM and vinculin-binding to talin. We demonstrate that actomyosin triggers RIAM dissociation from several talin domains. Actomyosin also provokes the sequential exchange of RIAM for vinculin on talin. The effect of RIAM on this force-dependent binding of vinculin to talin varies from one talin domain to another. This mechanism could allow talin to biochemically code a wide range of forces by selecting different combinations of partners.",

            "abstract": "Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.",

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.",

Its N-terminal globular head, which binds beta integrins, is linked to an extended rod having a C-terminal actin binding site and several vinculin binding sites (VBSs). The NMR structure of residues 755-889 of the rod (containing a VBS) is shown to be an amphipathic four-helix bundle with a left-handed topology. A talin peptide corresponding to the VBS binds the vinculin head; the X-ray crystallographic structure of this complex shows that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the talin fragment. NMR shows that the interaction involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its helices, making the VBS accessible to vinculin. Interestingly, the talin 755-889 fragment binds more than one vinculin head molecule, suggesting that the talin rod may contain additional as yet unrecognized VBSs.",

            "abstract": "Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein.",

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

Here we utilized indirect bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize a molecular complex containing a Mig-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) protein (Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) or lamellipodin), talin and activated integrins in living cells. This complex localizes at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions, thus corresponding to the tips of the 'sticky fingers.' Formation of the complex requires talin to form a bridge between the MRL protein and the integrins. Moreover, disruption of the MRL protein-integrin-talin (MIT) complex markedly impairs cell protrusion. These data reveal the molecular basis of the formation of 'sticky fingers' at the leading edge of migrating cells and show that an MIT complex drives these protrusions. ",

            "abstract": "MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.",

In mouse macrophages, MAYP is tyrosine phosphorylated after activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which also induces actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell spreading, polarization, and migration. Because MAYP associates with F-actin, we investigated the function of MAYP in regulating actin organization in macrophages. Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins and the N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex initiate the assembly of filamentous actin. Dia-interacting protein (DIP) binds via its amino-terminal SH3 domain to the proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of mDia1 and mDia2 and to the N-WASp proline-rich region. RESULTS: Here, we investigated an interaction between a conserved leucine-rich region (LRR) in DIP and the mDia FH2 domain that nucleates, processively elongates, and bundles actin filaments. DIP binding to mDia2 was regulated by the same Rho-GTPase-controlled autoinhibitory mechanism modulating formin-mediated actin assembly. DIP was previously shown to interact with and stimulate N-WASp-dependent branched filament assembly via Arp2/3. Despite direct binding to both mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains, DIP LRR inhibited only mDia2-dependent filament assembly and bundling in vitro. DIP expression interfered with filopodia formation, consistent with a role for mDia2 in assembly of these structures. After filopodia retraction into the cell body, DIP expression induced excessive nonapoptotic membrane blebbing, a physiological process involved in both cytokinesis and amoeboid cell movement. DIP-induced blebbing was dependent on mDia2 but did not require the activities of either mDia1 or Arp2/3. CONCLUSIONS: These observations point to a pivotal role for DIP in the control of nonbranched and branched actin-filament assembly that is mediated by Diaphanous-related formins and activators of Arp2/3, respectively. The ability of DIP to trigger blebbing also suggests a role for mDia2 in the assembly of cortical actin necessary for maintaining plasma-membrane integrity.",

            "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein talin, which is thought to couple integrins to F-actin, contains three binding sites (VBS1-VBS3) for vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility and whose activity is modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head (Vh) and vinculin tail (Vt) domains. In the present study we show that recombinant talin polypeptides containing the three VBSs (VBS1, residues 498-636; VBS2, residues 727-965; and VBS3, residues 1943-2157) each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within vinculin(1-258). A short synthetic talin VBS3 peptide (residues 1944-1969) was sufficient to inhibit binding of a (125)I-labelled talin VBS3 polypeptide to vinculin(1-258), and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this peptide forms a 1:1 complex in slow exchange with vinculin(1-258). Binding of the (125)I-labelled VBS3 polypeptide was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-propanol. Attempts to further define the talin-binding site within vinculin(1-258) using a gel-blot assay were unsuccessful, but near maximal talin-binding activity was retained by a construct spanning vinculin residues 1-131 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the talin VBS3 polypeptide was a potent inhibitor of the Vh-Vt interaction, and the VBS3 synthetic peptide was able to expose the actin-binding site in intact vinculin, which is otherwise masked by the Vh-Vt interaction. The results suggest that under certain conditions, talin may be an effective activator of vinculin.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large dimeric protein that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.",

            "abstract": "Endocytic processes are facilitated by both curvature-generating BAR-domain proteins and the coordinated polymerization of actin filaments. Under physiological conditions, the N-BAR protein Bin1 has been shown to sense and curve membranes in a variety of cellular processes. Recent studies have identified Bin1 as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although its possible pathological function in neurodegeneration is currently unknown. Here, we report that Bin1 not only shapes membranes, but is also directly involved in actin binding through its BAR domain. We observed a moderate actin bundling activity by human Bin1 and describe its ability to stabilize actin filaments against depolymerization. Moreover, Bin1 is also involved in stabilizing tau-induced actin bundles, which are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We also provide evidence for this effect in vivo, where we observed that downregulation of Bin1 in a Drosophila model of tauopathy significantly reduces the appearance of tau-induced actin inclusions. Together, these findings reveal the ability of Bin1 to modify actin dynamics and provide a possible mechanistic connection between Bin1 and tau-induced pathobiological changes of the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "abstract": "Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) have been reported: one in the N-terminal head, and two in the C-terminal rod domain. Although the C-terminal ABS3 has been partially characterized, the presence and properties of ABS1 within the talin head are less well defined. We show here that the talin head binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo at a specific site within the actin filament. Thus, purified talin head liberated from gizzard talin by calpain cleavage cosediments with F-actin in a low salt buffer at pH 6.4 (conditions that are optimal for binding intact talin), and using recombinant polypeptides, we have mapped ABS1 to the FERM domain within the talin head. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to binding, and EGFP-tagged FERM subdomains colocalize with actin stress fibers when expressed in COS cells. High-resolution electron microscopy of actin filaments decorated with F2F3 localizes binding to a site that is distinct from that recognized by members of the calponin-homology superfamily. Finally, we show that the FERM domain can couple F-actin to PIPkin, and by inference to integrins, since they bind to the same pocket in the F3 subdomain. This suggests that the talin FERM domain functions as a linker between PIPkin or integrins and F-actin at sites of cell-matrix adhesions.",

However, it is unclear how RIAM recruits talin and why its close homolog lamellipodin does not. Here, we report that, although RIAM possesses two talin-binding sites (TBS1 and TBS2), only TBS1 is capable of recruiting cytoplasmic talin to the PM, and the R8 domain is the strongest binding site in talin. Crystal structure of an R7R8:TBS1 complex reveals an unexpected kink in the TBS1 helix that is not shared in the homologous region of lamellipodin. This kinked helix conformation is required for the colocalization of RIAM and talin at the PM and proper activation of integrin. Our findings provide the structural and mechanistic insight into talin recruitment by RIAM that underlies integrin activation and explain the differential functions of the otherwise highly homologous RIAM and lamellipodin in integrin signaling.",

The cytoskeletal protein Talin1 links integrin adhesion receptors with the actin cytoskeleton. Talin1 and the other animal and amoebozoan talins are members of the I/LWEQ module superfamily, which also includes fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1/Hip1R. The I/LWEQ module is a conserved C-terminal structural element that is critical for I/LWEQ module protein function. The I/LWEQ module of Talin1 binds to F-actin and targets the protein to focal adhesions in vivo. The I/LWEQ modules of Sla2 and Hip1 are required for the participation of these proteins in endocytosis. In addition to these roles in I/LWEQ module protein function, we have recently shown that the I/LWEQ module also contains a determinant for protein dimerization. Taken together, these results suggest that actin binding, subcellular targeting, and dimerization are associated in I/LWEQ module proteins. In this report we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a putative coiled coil at the C-terminus of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module to show that the amino acids responsible for dimerization are necessary for F-actin binding, the stabilization of actin filaments, the cross-linking of actin filaments, and focal adhesion targeting. Our results suggest that this conserved dimerization motif in the I/LWEQ module plays an essential role in the function of Talin1 as a component of focal adhesions and, by extension, the other I/LWEQ module proteins in other multicomponent assemblies involved in cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking.",
