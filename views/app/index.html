<!--
  Derby templates are similar to Handlebars, except that they are first
  parsed as HTML, and there are a few extensions to make them work directly
  with models. A single HTML template defines the HTML output, the event
  handlers that update the model after user interaction, and the event handlers
  that update the DOM when the model changes.

  As in Handlebars, double curly braces output a value literally. Derby
  templates add single curly braces, which output a value and set up
  model <- -> view bindings for that object.

  Elements that end in colon define template names. Pre-defined templates
  are capitalized by convention, but template names are case-insensitive.
  Pre-defined templates are automatically included when the page is rendered.

    <div id="description-content">
      <p>Factoid helps authors to translate their written scientific text into formal descriptions of biological processes useful for sharing their results with others, bioinformatics analysis and integrating with other data to help build a more complete model of a cell.</p>

      <p>Factoid aims to be part of the publication process.  With the author's help, it will extract pathway and related information from a paper as it is submitted, submit the resulting diagram as a visual abstract for peer-review along with the paper and finally, publish the information in a shareable and computable format accompanying the paper for others to use.</p>

      <p>Factoid 1.0 helps turn text into a simple and editable network model of a biological process. Text is automatically converted to a first draft of a network which can then be corrected using easy to use editing functions.  Future versions will have more advanced text mining functionality to improve the 'first draft', will allow saving the results in standard formats for sharing and will make it easier to add text and edit the network.</p>
